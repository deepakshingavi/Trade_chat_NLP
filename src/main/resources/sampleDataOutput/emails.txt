**it’s getting to be the best time of year for stocks, and the dow could soon set a new high  -
[(source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/the-dow-could-soon-join-other-benchmarks-at-a-record-as-strong-november-seasonality-kicks-in.html)**
*****
&gt;
as november unfolds, stocks should continue to make gains in one of the best months of the year for
the market, and it’s very likely the dow will soon join other indexes in setting new
highs.
*****
&gt; the s&amp;p 500 and nasdaq both traded in record territory in the past trading
week, boosted by some better economic news, a better-than-expected earnings season, and hopes that
trade talks will soon lead to a first-phase deal between the u.s. and china. on friday, china said
it reached a consensus with the u.s. in principle after a phone call among high-level
negotiators.
*****
&gt; analysts say stocks could follow the seasonal trends higher, barring
problems in trade talks. the market is starting the best three months of the year historically, and
it has a few catalysts in the week ahead. there are a number of economic reports, the most important
of which will be the ism services pmi on tuesday.
*****
&gt; third-quarter earnings season
continues, with about 80 s&amp;p 500 companies reporting, including media companies disney and news
corp. and chipmaker qualcomm.
*****
&gt; # top months ahead for stocks
&gt; november is the
third-best month for the s&amp;p 500, which has been higher two-thirds of the time since world war
ii with an average 1.3% gain, according to cfra. as good as november has been, december is even
better, and as the no. 1 month, it is up 76% of the time with an average 1.6% gain. november,
however, is the month that has seen the most new highs for the s&amp;p, on a percentage basis,
according to cfra.
*****
&gt; “investors likely remain too skeptical on the impact of brexit, the
u.s.-china trade talks and the impeachment hearings. they’re too skeptical that the market can
advance,” said sam stovall, chief investment strategist at cfra. many strategists say the efforts by
democrats to impeach trump is not hurting stock prices currently but it could if there are any
developments that would put his re-election in doubt.
*****
&gt; “i think november and december are
pretty much going to buck the emotional trend right now. the market is telling us it wants to go
higher,” stovall said.
*****
&gt; of the more than 350 s&amp;p companies that have reported
earnings, 76% beat earnings estimates, according to i/b/e/s data from refinitiv. earnings are down
about 0.8% for the quarter, based on companies that have reported already and estimates.
*****
&gt;
“this will be the 31st consecutive quarter in which actuals exceed estimates, but as much as
earnings are coming in better for the quarter, they’re going down in terms of q4 and 2020. that’s
not good,” said stovall. but he said stocks could be lifted by the end of the trade war, the impact
of lowered interest rates and a possible tax cut from the white house.
*****
&gt; “i think because
the market is doing so well, it might be telling us we’re underestimating forward growth. prices
lead fundamentals,” he said.
*****
&gt; the s&amp;p and nasdaq soared into record territory friday
after the october jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls grew by 128,000, much greater than expected.
the number was weaker due to the strike against general motors but not as weak as feared.
*****
&gt;
the fed also added to positive sentiment with a rate cut on wednesday, but the central bank went out
of its way to signal a pause in policy.
*****
&gt; “the rally is definitely broadening out. the
measured move is 3,200 on the s&amp;p 500 by year-end. in the last two sessions, we retested and
spent some time above the 3,025 area. today’s move showed some needed power, after a jobs report
that was goldilocks: it had something for everyone, not too strong to have the fed as a headwind but
strong enough to keep recession fears away,” said scott redler, partner with t3live.com. “today’s
move lends some power to the bulls.”
*****
&gt; redler said apple’s performance this week was a big
boost to sentiment. it ended the week up 3.7%, at a new all-time high, after strong earnings.
“traders love when apple leads the way,” he said.
*****
&gt; the s&amp;p 500 was higher for a fourth
week in a row, its longest winning streak since march. the s&amp;p ended the week at 3,066, up 1.5%
for the week, while the nasdaq closed at a record 8,386, up 1.7% for the week. the dow gained 1.4%
for the week, lifted by a 301-point bounce friday. it finished the week at 27,347, 0.2% below its
all-time high of 27,398.
*****
&gt; historically, industrials have had the best gains on average in
november, going back to 1995. industrial stocks have been up an average 2.9%, followed by materials,
up 2.7%, consumer discretionary, up 2.6% and then technology, up 2.4%, according to cfra
data.
*****
&gt; “the cliche thing is everyone is focused on the breakout. i think the key technical
event that’s been developing for weeks, it’s really been this rotation toward cyclicals,” said
robert sluymer, technical strategist at fundstrat.
*****
&gt; he said he expects the dow to break to
new highs soon. “we think the market is strong through year end and well into 2020. we continue to
think the market cycle low developed in late 2018. this is the next leg up in the bull market,” he
said.
*****
&gt; # what are bonds saying?
&gt; the bond market did not respond in the same way as
stocks to the jobs number. yields were slightly higher friday but remained near or below the level
they were at just prior to the fed rate cut on wednesday.
*****
&gt; “we’re actually down on the
week. that tells you what the bond market thinks about the economic landscape, particularly with the
jobs report. i know there’s a lot of enthusiasm about it,” said peter boockvar, chief investment
officer with bleakley advisory group. “the bond market continues to send a very different message
than the optimism in the equities market. the pace of job growth is still slowing, and this number
is going to get revised multiple times. everything is pointing to a slowdown in growth.”
*****
&gt;
the 10-year treasury yield was at 1.73% friday afternoon, and it had been at 1.80% at the end of the
prior week.
*****
&gt; “i think it’s a bit of moderation from the sell-off we saw last week. the fed
was pretty much in line with what people were expecting,” said ben jeffery, a rate strategist at
bmo. “i think probably stocks are viewing it as the fed is comfortable leaving rates on hold, so
many recessionary fears are a bit overblown. you could make the argument the bond market is less
convinced about that.”
*****
&gt; however, stovall said it’s a positive for stocks when the yield on
the 10-year is lower than the yield on the s&amp;p 500, now about 2%.
*****
&gt; “i would say
another positive for stocks is historically when the dividend yield on the s&amp;p 500 has exceeded
the yield on the 10-year note. the average 12-month return for the s&amp;p has exceeded 22%,” he
said.

# typical november trading: first month of “best
months”

&gt; november’s long-term track record has been stellar. it is the number one month of the
year for s&amp;p 500 since 1950 with an average gain of 1.6%, up 47 times in 69 years. djia’s record
matches s&amp;p 500, up 47 of 69 with an average gain of 1.6% although november is djia’s second
best month. nasdaq also averages a 1.6% gain in november (second best), up 33 times in 48 years
(since 1971).

&gt; over the more recent 21-year period, 1998 to 2018, november’s average
performance has remained solid. november has opened well with gains during the first four or five
trading days depending on index. from there trading has become rather choppy with gains receding
through mid-month before a low around the fourteenth trading day. at which point bullish holiday
spirit has kicked in around thanksgiving propelling all indexes to a strong rally to finish the
month.

next week's economic indicators - 11/1/19

&gt; it was an extremely busy week for economic data with
over 40 releases on the calendar. a vast majority came in either inline or worse relative to
expectations or the previous period, while only 27% of releases came in stronger than expected or
above the prior reading.

&gt; the chicago fed’s national activity index was the first release of
the week, turning back into negative territory in september. the dallas fed’s manufacturing activity
index was also released on monday and also missed estimates while shifting negative. the conference
board’s reading on consumer confidence also softened unexpectedly as the spread between present
conditions and expectations widened further. housing data was somewhat mixed as prices slowed
slightly, but pending home sales was much better than expected. wednesday’s gdp release also came in
stronger than expected with solid personal consumption. core pce and other inflation indicators like
the employment cost index were inline with expectations. finally, wednesday also saw the fomc rate
decision which resulted in rated cut another 25 bps, as expected. adp’s stronger than expected
employment data, preceded a solid nfp report on friday. nonfarm payrolls were expected to show 85k
added jobs in the month of october which would have been a substantially weaker number than the 136k
increase the prior month. instead, actual results showed 128k added jobs, which was better than all
but the highest of estimates (140k). another focus on friday was the markit and ism readings on
manufacturing. both were expected to improve from the prior month which they in fact did but by less
than estimates were calling for. markit's preliminary pmi was originally showing a stronger reading
of 51.5. instead, the final reading came in at 51.3 which was still the highest reading since april
so the report wasn't entirely bad. meanwhile, the ism index ticked up off of last month's reading of
47.8, its lowest levels since june of 2009. this was in part thanks to the readings on new orders
and employment improving. aside from these improvements, ism's indices—unlike markit—are still
showing contraction in the manufacturing space.

&gt; ###### **([click here for the
chart!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/eco-1.png))**

&gt; the economic calendar
slows down next week with around half as many releases as this week. final durable and capital goods
data and factory orders will take up the entirety of monday’s reports. durable goods orders are not
expected to show any change from the preliminary readings, but factory orders are expected to show
moderation in september. on tuesday, we will get the services counterparts to today’s ism and markit
manufacturing gauges. while both manufacturing readings missed, ism’s non-manufacturing index is
anticipated to rise to 53.5. quarterly mortgage delinquencies and foreclose data will also be out on
tuesday. wednesday will see more quarterly data with the q3 preliminary releases of nonfarm
productivity and unit labor costs. following this week’s weaker confidence report from the
conference board, next friday we will get further clarification on sentiment with the university of
michigan’s preliminary november data.

# price-to-earnings
around the globe

&gt; every wednesday, we release our global macro dashboard, which tracks major
data economic and market data points from 23 of the largest global economies. one stat we include is
each country's p/e ratio for their respective equity markets. india continues to have the highest
valuation with a p/e of 26.9. that compares to the us which is now valued at 20.1x earnings and the
fifth-highest of the countries tracked. this is also higher than the average p/e for all of these
countries which is 17.02. other countries with notably high valuations include norway, germany, and
switzerland. russia, on the other hand, has by far the lowest valuation of just 6.41, the only
country with a p/e in the single digits.

&gt; ###### **([click here for the
chart!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/pe1.png))**

&gt; compared to where things
stood six months and one year ago, valuations around the globe have collectively risen. the world
average now stands at 17.0 versus 16.4 at the end of april and 15.1 last october. while the average
multiple has increased, only 60% of the countries tracked have seen valuations increase over the
last 6 months while 74% have risen over the past year. germany's p/e has actually risen the most of
these having jumped to the third-highest p/e of all countries (22.6). six months and one year ago,
germany (ewg) actually had a below-average p/e. multiple expansion can come in the form of higher
prices and/or lower earnings, and in the case of germany, the culprit has been weaker
earnings.

&gt; even though it currently continues to hold the number one spot on the list,
multiples in india (inda) have actually fallen over the past six months from 30.4 down to the
current level of 26.9. given inda has fallen over 2.5%, this lower valuation makes better sense than
the jump in germany. similarly, in regards to the us, the ratio rising to over 20 from 19.28 comes
is a result of the s&amp;p 500's 3% gain as earnings have been pretty flat.

&gt; compared to one
year ago, it is a similar story. as is the case now, russia and hong kong have had the lowest
valuations over the past six months and one year, although they have risen in that time. the
valuation for most countries have risen over the past year.

&gt; ###### **([click here
for the chart!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/pe-y.png))**

&gt; summarizing in
the table below, there is a bit of a mixed picture in regards to how p/e ratios have changed with
performance over the past half-year and year. one would expect the ratio to increase as equities
rise, but that has not necessarily been the universal case. for countries like norway (enor) and
germany (ewg), valuations have risen the most in spite of equity markets that have experienced
declines over the past six months (norway's declines being the fourth-worst of the 23 countries) and
only modest gains in the past year. on the other hand, russia (rsx) has the lowest valuation of all
countries despite having outperformed dramatically over the last six to twelve months. rsx has also
not seen any major surge in valuation in that time as earnings have kept up with prices. meanwhile,
other countries like india (inda), switzerland (ewl), taiwan (ewt) and the us (spy) have seen this
dynamic react more in line with what could be expected.

# guidance trends
lower

&gt; our good friend (and a former boss) laszlo birinyi used to hammer home that "it's all
about the guidance!" when it comes to earnings reports for specific companies. that is indeed very
true as investors discount stocks based on forward projections more than what they've done in the
past. on the subject of guidance, this season we've been seeing a lot more companies lower guidance
than raise guidance, which has resulted in a pretty big tick lower in our guidance spread reading on
our earnings explorer page (available to bespoke institutional members).

&gt; our guidance spread
reading shows the difference between the percentage of companies that have raised guidance and
lowered guidance over the last three months on a rolling basis. a positive reading means more
companies have raised guidance than lowered guidance over the last three months and vice versa for a
negative reading. as you can see, the reading is currently at -6.48 percentage points, which is well
below the historical average of -2.97. (it's notable that historically the average guidance spread
has been negative, which tells us that in general companies like to under-promise and over-deliver.)
the guidance spread completely tanked in the first quarter of 2019 before stabilizing and rallying
back during the summer. while it hasn't been in positive territory all year, the spread did briefly
get above its historical average during the q2 reporting period in july.

&gt; a negative guidance
reading means companies are less optimistic about the future than they could be, but it's not
necessarily a bearish sign for the stock market. if anything, it gives companies an easier chance at
beating estimates going forward as long as the economy doesn't completely fall off a cliff. as you
can see in the second chart below that extends our guidance spread reading all the way back to 2003,
the current reading is hardly a negative outlier to be concerned about. the only time the spread
really collapsed was in mid to late 2008 in the midst of the financial crisis. want to see bespoke's
best analysis?

#
the u.s. economy chugs along

&gt; gross domestic product (gdp) growth slowed for a third quarter,
but the u.s. economy is still chugging along at an average pace.

&gt; gdp grew 1.9% in the third
quarter, its slowest pace of growth since the fourth quarter of 2018, as shown in the lpl chart of
the day. still, gdp increased 2% year over year last quarter, slightly below 2.1% year-over-year
average growth since the cycle started in july 2009.

&gt; ###### **([click here for the
chart!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/solid-consumer-spending_1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt;
the composition of growth last quarter showed u.s. consumers pulled the economy along once again.
consumer spending contributed 1.9 percentage points to the gdp increase during the quarter, while
government spending added 0.4 percentage points. housing contributed 0.2 percentage points, a nice
surprise after residential investment dragged on growth for six straight quarters.

&gt; business
spending reduced overall gdp growth by 0.4 percentage points, its biggest drag on growth since the
fourth quarter of 2015. growth in capital expenditures (capex) has stalled as u.s. companies have
shelved expansion plans amid a surge in global uncertainty.

&gt; “the economy continues to muddle
through at an average pace of growth,” said lpl financial senior market strategist ryan detrick.
“while we’re not surprised to see another dull quarter for capex, we’d like to see business spending
eventually pick up this late in the cycle. higher business spending could provide a boost to
productivity, and higher productivity could jumpstart gdp growth.”

&gt; unfortunately, we don’t
expect to see a material increase in capex growth until the united states and china make more
significant progress on the trade front. the u.s.-china limited trade deal could provide some lift
as tensions thaw, but we think companies may need to see more evidence of a larger compromise before
feeling confident enough to spend.

# **perfect summer storm brewing for stock correction as trade war simmers and more fed
action awaited  -
[(source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/02/perfect-storm-building-for-market-correction.html)**
*****
&gt;
with new risks from trade wars, stocks head into the final weeks of summer vulnerable to a pull back
or even correction.
*****
&gt; the market was down sharply in the past week, buffeted first by
disappointment over the fed’s more hawkish-than-expected policy outlook. then they were beaten down
by fears president donald trump is starting a new front in the trade wars with china that is
unlikely to end any time soon.
*****
&gt; “the real issue as to why there’s going to be a correction
in our view is there’s a massive, massive vacuum here,” said julian emanuel, head of equity and
derivative strategy at btig. “in essence, it’s a month and a half of a vacuum, if you think about
the direction of the rhetoric. ... the issues are china, the issues are the fed and the issues are
brexit. in the first tow, you’re almost not going to hear anything.”
*****
&gt; trump, in
threatening new tariffs on $300 billion in chinese goods on thursday, said the tariffs would go into
effect on sept. 1 unless china acts, but no new talks are expected before september. economists said
if the tariffs are put in place, the risks of a u.s. recession rise, particularly if businesses step
back from investment, and possibly even hiring. but that could also prompt the fed to cut interest
rates to rescue the economy when it meets in september.
*****
&gt; after a deluge of corporate
headlines in the past several weeks, the earnings season is also winding down with just about 60
major companies reporting in the week ahead, and there are no really significant economic reports
until the middle of the month.
*****
&gt; emanuel said the s&amp;p 500 could see a decline to about
2,789, though he still expects to see 3,000 at the end of the year. stocks started the past week
near all-time highs, and the s&amp;p 500 was was down more than 3% in the past week, but still up
about 17% for the year-to-date. odds are high that stocks pull back in august, since for the past
eight years, the s&amp;p 500 was negative during august in six of them.
*****
&gt; emanuel said if
stocks decline too much or too long, he expects to see some action from the white house that will
halt the selling.
*****
&gt; “if you’re the president, there’s no way you’re going to allow an
economic slowdown in an election year,” said emanuel.
*****
&gt; barry knapp, managing partner at
ironsides macroeconomics, said friday the escalation of the trade wars has made him more risk
adverse, and he would lighten up holdings in the sectors he had favored—industrials, technology and
transportation stocks.
*****
&gt; “we could have a correction ... then we’ll have to see how the
policy makers respond to it,′ knapp said. “the risks are significant. i think we’ll get a
correction. ... we could trade back to the may lows, somewhere around 2,750. then we’ll see how the
administration responds. this was a seasonally vulnerable period.”
*****
&gt; the fed cut its target
fed funds rate range wednesday for the first time in a decade, but it does not have another meeting
until sept. 17, though fed official hold their annual symposium in jackson hole at the end of
august.
*****
&gt; fed chairman jerome powell disappointed markets when he said the fed was in a
“midcycle adjustment,” not a longer term rate cutting cycle but by friday, futures markets were
indicating a nearly 100% chance the fed will cut interest rates in september.
*****
&gt; “clearly
from the fed, you’re going to get silence, until the end of the month in jackson hole where you may
hear something but nothing of materiality,” said emanuel. “all the chinese leadership is by the
seaside for the next couple of weeks...what you’re going to get for the next two weeks is next to
total silence.”
*****
&gt; emanuel said brexit is also a risk for markets, as the u.k. gets closer
to the oct. 31 deadline to leave the european union. “in all likelihood, if you hear something
between now and then, it’s basically going to increase the perception that brinkmanship toward the
oct. 31 deadline becomes more a reality every day, and this is reflected in the fact the british
sterling is collapsing,” he said. the market has been speculating that the odds of a hard brexit are
increasing, meaning britain leaves the eu with no plan.
*****
&gt; interest rates and currency
wars
&gt; currency markets were volatile in the past week, but the dollar index was basically flat
by friday afternoon. traders were monitoring both the moves in the foreign exchange market and fixed
income markets.
*****
&gt; as for the bond market, the declines in yields in the past week were
dramatic, with about a 30 basis point move in the 10-year yield in just two days. treasury yields
were bouncing along 2016 levels. the 10-year moved from about 2.07% ahead of the fed news to less
than 1.85% it was at 1.87% friday afternoon.
*****
&gt; yields, which move opposite price, also had
moved lower on the trump trade threats.
*****
&gt; “now everybody is waiting for the next tweet.
unfortunately, there’s no economics calendar for when those come out,′ said jon hill, rate
strategist at bmo.
*****
&gt; hill said traders will be watching the three auctions, $38 billion in
3-year notes tuesday; a record $27 billion 10-years wednesday and the record $19 billion 30-year
long bond auction, on thursday.
*****
&gt; hill said the market will be watching ism
nonmanufacturing data tuesday to see if the services side of the economy is still holding up. “it’s
been a point of continued strength,” he said, noting at the same time manufacturing has been in
decline.
*****
&gt; knapp said he is also worried that the dollar could strengthen on the trade war,
and hurt emerging market currencies and u.s. profits. he noted that the chinese currency weakened
against the dollar overnight.
*****
&gt; he said he is concerned currency volatility could “just
start to have this big disruption that could be another factor that would just bleed into risk
markets like the equity market.”

# next week's economic indicators - 8/2/19

&gt;
economic data may have taken a bit of a backseat amidst the fomc meeting wednesday and tariff
headlines at the tail end of the week, but the us still had a heavy slate with 38 total
releases.

&gt; data was broadly weaker with almost twice as many releases coming in weaker (20)
than stronger (11) relative to forecasts (or the prior release when there was no consensus
forecast). the dallas fed kicked off the week with a weaker than expected reading on manufacturing
activity, but it was an improvement from june’s level of negative 12.1. in other manufacturing data,
on thursday we got markit and ism pmis which were mixed. while markit was stronger, the headline
reading of ism was weaker; new orders did improve, however. headline factory orders were also
weaker, but excluding transportation they were unchanged. as forecasted, personal income and
spending weakened while inflation came in at a slower than expected pace on tuesday. the conference
board’s consumer confidence indices were the main bright spot of the week with stronger readings
across the board. claims data continued to show a slower pace of improvement on thursday as both
initial and continuing claims came in above expectations. meanwhile, friday’s nonfarm payrolls
report was the most inline with expectations since october 2012, coming in only 1k below forecasts
of 165k.

&gt;
economic data is much lighter next week. the non-manufacturing portions of ism and markit pmis are
due on monday. jolts and consumer credit are out on wednesday. producer inflation gauges are set to
be released friday.

fakeouts

&gt; throughout the course of the entire year, large caps have been leading the market
higher, and they are the only market cap range of the equity market to actually make new highs in
the most recent leg higher for equities. after this week's pullback, though, the s&amp;p 500 is
coming perilously close to breaking through support at the prior highs from april and last fall. a
close below those levels today would not be a great mood-setter for the bulls heading into the
weekend.

&gt; ###### **([click here for the
chart!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-spx.png))**

&gt; for mid
and small caps, the picture is even less optimistic. the s&amp;p 400 mid cap index never came close
to a new high in the most recent rally, but it did appear to break its downtrend from the highs late
last year. but that breakout quickly turned to a fakeout this week as the s&amp;p 400 broke back
down below its prior downtrend line and is breaking below the 50-dma today.

&gt; ###### **([click
here for the
chart!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-mid.png))**

&gt; for the
small-cap russell 2000, it's an identical picture. in this case, the break above the downtrend line
was even more short-lived, and like the s&amp;p 400, the russell 2000 is not only back below its
50-dma, but it also isn't that far from breaking below its 200-dma.

#
earnings season déjà vu

&gt; is it happening again? after what has to this point been a perfectly
good earnings season for the us stock market sending the s&amp;p 500 to new all-time highs in the
process, the president spoiled the party yesterday when he tweeted that a new round of tariffs would
be instituted on chinese imports. stocks had erased all of their declines from powell's wednesday
press conference by mid-day thursday, but then the president’s tweet sent equity markets reeling
with the dow falling more than 1%, while the yield on the 10-year us treasury fell back below
2%.

&gt; if this whole scenario sounds familiar to you, that’s because we saw the same thing last
quarter. remember back in april when the s&amp;p 500 rallied to new highs in the early weeks of
earnings season? there was a feeling then that the market was finally breaking out of its rut and on
the path to a sustained breakout. but then over the first weekend of may, on a sunday afternoon no
less, the president sent out a series of tweets outlining his plan for increased tariffs on chinese
imports. the following monday, the market opened lower and kept falling throughout the month. by the
end of may, the s&amp;p 500 was down 6.6% for the month, making it the worst may for the s&amp;p 500
since 2010. august has historically been an iffy month for the stock market as many on wall street
take vacations and try to relax, but if the market follows the earnings season script from last
quarter, this will be an august of little rest.

president takes matters into his own hands

&gt; the president has been frustrated with the federal
reserve’s prior rate hikes and now the lack of a more substantial cut in rates. just the other day,
trump was quoted as saying, “obama had zero interest rates, we have ‘normalized’ rates. while the
fed hasn’t helped the president’s cause, he has seemingly taken matters into his own hands with his
policy towards china. each time he ratchets up the rhetoric against china, it tends to put
additional downward pressure on interest rates, and following thursday’s tweets, the yield on the
10-year plummetted below 1.9%.

&gt; ironically enough, the last time the 10-year yield was this low
was on election day 2016. while short-term borrowing costs are up as the fomc has hiked rates during
trump's time in office, the yield on the 10-year isn’t much different. under the eight years of
president obama, the yield on the 10-year averaged 2.47%, while under trump the average yield has
been 2.57%.

&gt; ###### **([click here for the
chart!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-10-year-yield.png))**

&gt;
the chart below shows a shorter-term look at the 10-year yield over the last year and it has
practically been in free-fall the entire time. ever since late 2018, every time the yield has
attempted to make a move above its 50-dma, it has reversed lower, with the most recent leg lower in
may coinciding with another series of tweets concerning tariffs on chinese goods.

&gt; ######
**([click here for the
chart!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080119-10yr-yield.png))**

&gt;
while not a lot of stocks have benefitted from the president’s policy tweets on chinese tariffs, the
impact of lower interest rates has been cheered on by the homebuilders as they have practically been
a completely inverse image of the move in rates. just yesterday, the group hit a new high before
pulling back a bit, but lower long-term interest rates mean lower mortgage payments, and that helps
to make housing more affordable for millions of millennials looking for a place of their own.

outside day for gold (gld)

&gt; even though assets have been selling off across the board in
response to wednesday's fed decision and the president's announcement of increased tariffs
yesterday, there is one bullish point to be found. yesterday, gold (gld) had initially moved
slightly lower around the open but then surged into the close, finishing the day only a couple of
cents off of the intraday high. not only did gld fully recoup the morning's losses, but it also
gained back the previous day's losses and then some. this outside day/bullish engulfing pattern is
typically seen as a bullish technical signal.

&gt; ###### **([click here for the
chart!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gld.png))**

&gt; this pattern has
occurred a total of 35 times in the history of the gold etf (gld). below we show the 10 previous
times that this pattern was observed after not having occurred in the previous six months. despite
being a bullish setup, performance in the next week has actually had a negative bias with an average
return of -0.57%. the past five times have seen a loss in the following week. likewise, three months
out sees better than average returns but the probability of gld trading higher is the just the same
as a coinflip. but, generally, in the months and year after, gld continues to trend higher on
average with more consistent gains in the next month, 6 months, and year periods. returns are also
better than normal across these time frames.

solid jobs growth in july

&gt; the job market continues to be a pillar of strength for the u.s.
economy.

&gt; nonfarm payrolls rose 164,000 in july, in line with consensus estimates for a 165,000
gain, according to the jobs report released august 2. as shown in the lpl chart of the day, solid
jobs growth in july, job creation has slowed slightly this year amid the aging economic expansion,
but not to levels that concern us. the 12-month average payrolls gain through july was 187,000,
still an above-average pace for the expansion.

&gt; ###### **([click here for the
chart!](https://i.imgur.com/nsnykyz.png))**

&gt; strength in the job market is especially important
these days as u.s. consumers increasingly bear the weight of economic growth. consumer activity
added 2.9 percentage points to second quarter gross domestic product (gdp), carrying gdp growth to
2.1%.

&gt; initial jobless claims, a leading economic indicator, have also pointed to firm
labor-market conditions. the four-week average for unemployment claims fell to the fifth-lowest
level of the expansion through july 26.

&gt; “we’ve been encouraged by the labor market’s
resiliency amid recent global uncertainty,” said lpl research chief investment strategist john
lynch. “a solid labor market should continue to bolster consumer confidence and buoy economic
activity.”

&gt; average hourly earnings grew 3.2% year over year in july, a faster pace than june’s
growth and at a healthy clip for the u.s. consumer. wages constitute about 70% of business costs, so
we’re hoping meaningful pay increases will eventually help lift consumer inflation, countering
weakness in global demand. the unemployment rate climbed to 3.7%, still near a cycle low.

# august:
better in pre-election years, but still not great

&gt; money flows from harvesting made august a
great stock market month in the first half of the twentieth century. it was the best month from 1901
to 1951. in 1900, 37.5% of the population was farming. now that less than 2% farm, august is amongst
the worst months of the year. it is the worst djia, s&amp;p 500, nasdaq, russell 1000 and russell
2000 month over the last 31 years, 1988-2018 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by nasdaq to
1.1% by djia.

&gt; in pre-election years since 1950, augusts’ rankings improve modestly: #7 djia,
#8 s&amp;p 500, #10 nasdaq (since 1971), #9 russell 1000 and #10 russell 2000 (since 1979). average
performance in pre-election years is positive except for russell 2000 which is unchanged.

&gt;
contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the shortest bear market in history (45 days)
caused by turmoil in russia, the asian currency crisis and the long-term capital management hedge
fund debacle ending august 31, 1998 with the djia shedding 6.4% that day. djia dropped a record
1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage djia loss since
1950. saddam hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in august 1990. the best djia gains occurred in 1982
(11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. sizeable losses in 2010, 2011 and 2013 of over 4% on
djia have widened augusts’ average decline. a strong august in 2014 of s&amp;p 3.8% and nasdaq 4.8%
preceded corrections of 7.4% and 8.4% respectively from mid-september to mid-october.

**the stock market is running out of steam with reopening trades fading and economic data ‘uneven’ 
-
[(source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/19/the-stock-market-is-running-out-of-steam-with-reopening-trades-fading-and-economic-data-uneven.html)**
*****
&gt;
federal reserve chairman jerome powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank
will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. that should be enough to keep investors moving
into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the s&amp;p 500 into the green for
2020.
*****
&gt; the stock market, so eager to put the entire blow from the pandemic behind it, is
now coming to terms that a “v-shaped” recovery might be too rosy a scenario. 
*****
&gt; with recent
spikes in coronavirus cases and fluctuations in the economic data, the market seems to be stuck in a
range amid elevated volatility. market analysts said investors should expect more turbulence ahead
because the economic recovery is most likely to be bumpy.
*****
&gt; “the market was priced for a
continuation of improvement and i think that’s overstating what’s going to happen,” said brian
levitt, invesco’s global market strategist. “we are going to have episodes of cases rising. we are
going to have a very slow and uneven improvement in the jobs market.”
*****
&gt; after soaring more
than 40% from the march lows, the s&amp;p 500 turned sideways in the past two weeks, trading at
similar levels to early june. the market, which used to turn a blind eye to disastrous news on the
thinking that the economy had already bottomed, has become more vulnerable to negative economic
headlines as the data begins to give a read on the shape of the recovery.
*****
&gt; stocks came
under pressure earlier this week after data showed weekly jobless claims rose more than expected
last week, and the number stayed above 1 million for the 13th consecutive week. 
*****
&gt; and on
the virus front, california, texas, florida and arizona have reported an uptick in new infections
and hospitalizations amid the reopening. apple said friday that it’s again closing some stores in
florida, north carolina and arizona due to the spikes in coronavirus cases, which sparked a sell-off
in the market, especially among retail stocks.
*****
&gt; “the economy is going to need more help to
bounce back in months to come,” said matt miskin, co-chief investment strategist at john hancock
investment management. “for now, volatility and choppy markets remain our base case as an uneven
economic recovery likely unfolds.”
*****
&gt; # ‘rolling ws’
&gt; the rally in those popular
reopening trades — airlines, cruise lines and hotels — is seemingly losing steam. shares of american
airlines and delta posted their second straight weekly losses. so did carnival, norwegian cruise and
mgm resorts. those stocks were once the high-beta leaders of the market comeback as investors bet
that a successful reopening would take hold. 
*****
&gt; “although the stock market was suggesting a
v-shaped recovery, the more likely scenario is rolling ws,” liz ann sonders, chief investment
strategist at charles schwab, said in a note.
*****
&gt; a similar market pattern happened during
the financial crisis, pointed out by nicholas colas, co-founder of datatrek research. after stocks
rallied nearly 40% from the 2009 bottom, the market was range-bound for about seven weeks so the
fundamentals could catch up, colas noted.
*****
&gt; from a technical perspective, matthew maley,
chief market strategist at miller tabak, is watching if the s&amp;p 500 can break above its recent
high of 3,232 or drop below the 3,000 threshold or its 200-day moving average of 3,018 as of
friday.
*****
&gt; “whichever way it breaks...should be an very important development in trying to
determine how this critical juncture in the stock market will be resolved,” maley said in a
note.
*****
&gt; # fed can’t prevent volatility
&gt; while the flattening virus curve played a big
role in the market rebound, it’s no denying that the federal reserve’s unprecedented stimulus has
been a key driver in lifting stocks from the coronavirus slump. the central bank unleashed another
weapon in its arsenal this week, saying it will start buying individual corporate bonds.
*****
&gt;
as comforting as it is to have the fed’s support, the central bank can only do so much to ease
investor fears.
*****
&gt; “the fed can’t prevent the volatility we’re seeing in stocks,” lindsey
bell, chief investment strategist at ally invest, said in a note. “it will likely take years for the
economy to fully recover and there remain other uncertainties on the path ahead. as such, investors
may continue to struggle with this mismatch between markets and the economy before seeing the case
for new highs.”
*****
&gt; fed chairman jerome powell reminded investors again this week in his
semiannual testimony before congress that “significant uncertainty remains about the timing and
strength of the recovery.”
*****
&gt; many on wall street have also warned that extended policy
measures including injection of trillions of cheap money would lead to problems down the road such
as hyperinflation.

# 100 days

&gt; 100
days ago today on march 11th, the who made it official and declared the covid-19 outbreak a
pandemic. markets were already under a lot of pressure before the who declared the pandemic, but the
100 days since will probably go down as some of the craziest 100 days we'll ever experience, not
only in the market but in general society as well. more than enough ink and pixels have been spent
discussing the societal impact at large, so we'll spare you and just focus on the markets.

&gt;
while much of the declines were already in the rearview mirror by the time the who made its
announcement, equities still had a steep decline in the immediate aftermath. the large-cap russell
1000, for example, fell another 19% to its march 23rd closing low, but after the rebound, the net
change since the pandemic was officially declared &gt; has been a gain of 14.3%.

&gt; ######
**([click here for the
chart!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061920-russell-1000.png))**

&gt; as
impressive as the russell 1000's gain has been in the face of the global pandemic, many stocks have
done a lot better than that. the table below lists the 25 stocks in the index that have seen the
biggest gains so far during this pandemic. topping the list is wayfair (w) which has rallied more
than 350%. if there is one thing americans must have realized while they were stuck at home under
lockdown it was that they needed some new furniture! behind wayfair, two other stocks have more than
tripled and both were beaten down stocks from the energy sector that were trading at less than $2
per share on march 11th. a number of familiar names standout including moderna (mrna), twilio
(twlo), docusign (docu), beyond meat (bynd), and etsy (etsy), but looking through the list, there's
really a diverse group of names ranging from bombed-out stocks from the energy sector (8 stocks),
consumer names (7 stocks), and the ever-popular software stocks from the technology sector (6
stocks). it's definitely been a rocky road for the markets over the last 100 days, but for anyone
who had these names in their portfolio, they aren't complaining. click here to view bespoke's

#
s&amp;p 500 industry group breadth remains positive

&gt; equity markets have become a bit wobbly in
the last week or so, but breadth, in terms of large-cap industry groups, still remains pretty
robust. relative to their 50-dmas, all 24 s&amp;p 500 industry groups still have rising 50-dmas.
when you consider the fact that the 50-day window spans the period going back to early april, a
period encompassing most of what was one of the strongest 50-day rallies on record, the fact that
every industry group has a rising 50-dma isn't all that surprising.

&gt; ###### **([click here for
the chart!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061920-rising-50dma.png))**

&gt; even
though all their 50-dmas are rising, not every industry group is currently trading above its 50-dma.
while the reading briefly reached 100% in late may and early june, two industry groups have since
pulled back below their 50-dmas, putting the percentage at a still impressive 91.7%.

&gt; ######
**([click here for the
chart!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061920-above-50-dma.png))**

&gt; the table
below summarizes industry group performance showing ytd performance, where each one is trading
relative to its 50-dma, as well as where the group is trading relative to its 52-week high.

&gt; as
mentioned above, all but two groups (drugs &amp; biotech and food &amp; staples retail) remain above
their 50-dmas, and another four are less than 2% above their 50-dma. if friday's sell-off deepens
into next week, the percentage of industry groups above their 50-dmas has the potential to quickly
sink as low as 75%. of the 22 industry groups that are above their 50-dmas, autos and tech hardware
are the only two greater than 10% above.

&gt; on a ytd basis, the s&amp;p 500 is down less than 4%,
but for the vast majority of industry groups, performance has been worse than that. of the 24 groups
shown, 16 are down more than 4% ytd, including eleven that are down over 10%. the worst performers
of these losers include energy, banks, and autos. while energy gets most of the attention for being
so weak, banks are essentially down just as much! on the upside, just two industry groups are up
over 10% (retailers, which is basically amazon, and software &amp; services). retailing is also the
one industry group that is within 1% of a 52-week high and one of seven that is within 4% of a
52-week high.

#
credit market reversals

&gt; we've noted in detail the massive reversals seen in global equities
over the last three months, but outside of equities, we've also seen some other massive moves. one
example is credit spreads between the yields of corporate and high yield bonds relative to
treasuries.

&gt; the top chart below shows the spread in yields between the b of a corporate index
relative to treasuries going back to 1997, and below that, we show the 50-day rate of change in the
spread. heading into the covid-crash, spreads on corporate bonds were less than 100 basis points
(bps), meaning the corporate bond index was yielding only 1 percentage point more than comparable
treasury yields. in the span of less than two months, though, spreads surged by more than 300 bps to
over 400 bps. not since the depths of the credit crisis in 2009 had we seen spreads widen out more
than they did in march. just as notable as the level is the fact that the speed with which spreads
widened during the covid-crash was similar to the pace during the credit crisis.

&gt; while spreads
were quick to spike during both crises, they narrowed nearly as fast both times. going back to 1997,
the most corporate spreads have ever narrowed over a 50-day period was in june 2009. coming in at a
close second place, though, the 50-day period ending in early june was nearly as extreme.

&gt;
###### **([click here for the
chart!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061820-corporates.png))**

&gt; similar to
spreads on corporate bonds, the movement in spreads on high yield (junk) credit has been nearly as
extreme. while spreads on the b of a high yield master index widened out by only half as much during
the covid-crash as they did during the financial crisis, the 50-day move ending in late march was
easily more extreme than any other period outside of the credit crisis.

&gt; ###### **([click here
for the chart!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061820-high-yield.png))**

&gt; a
shown in both charts above, the only time both corporate and high yield spreads narrowed by an
amount anywhere close to the amount they narrowed from late march through early june was back in
early june of 2009. the chart below of the s&amp;p 500 shows that point from the perspective of the
s&amp;p 500. that period in june 2009 was right in the early stages of what turned out to be a
multi-year bull market. given the similar tightening in the credit market now versus back then,
should we assume a similar move for equities going forward?

&gt; after the last five months, we'll
be the first to say that anything is possible. however, while there are plenty of similarities
between the moves in credit markets over the last three months versus the first half of 2009, there
are also important distinctions. the most important of these has to do with where the s&amp;p 500 is
trading right now. the second chart below shows the historical levels the s&amp;p 500 has traded at
relative to its all-time high. even after the initial narrowing of credit spreads from march through
early june 2009, the s&amp;p 500 was still more than 40% off its all-time highs, and therefore still
had a lot of climbing to do to get out of the hole. back in june 2009, to get back to its all-time
high from october 2007, the s&amp;p 500 still had to rally another 75%. today, it's a much different
picture as the s&amp;p 500 is already within 10% of its february 2020 all-time high. could we be in
the earlier stages of what turns out to be another long-term bull market? sure. will the magnitude
of the gains be anything like the gains early on in the bull market that began in 2009? it's
unlikely.

# the very
slow recovery in economic activity is continuing

&gt; as economies around the country slowly
recover from covid-19 and reopenings proceed, economic activity is slowly recovering. for the
hardest-hit sectors, though, the recovery is only inching forward. security checkpoint volumes at us
airports are still down 80% yoy, and the trend of improvement is only set to return travel activity
to 50% of 2019 levels in september.

&gt; for restaurants, opentable data shows covers down by
two-thirds from last year, though some of that is because many restaurants remain closed. among
reopened establishments, the number of seated customers are still down almost 40% yoy. about half of
restaurants remain closed per the opentable data. we discussed this chart and other retail
enthusiasm indicators in last night's closer report, which is available to bespoke institutional

leading indicators turn positive

&gt; yesterday, the conference board released last month’s reading
for its leading economic index (lei), a composite of leading data series, which showed a
month-over-month increase of 2.8%. as seen in the lpl chart of the day, the return to positive
territory follows three straight months of negative monthly growth.

&gt; ”we noted that the pace of
the lei’s deterioration slowed in the april report, potentially suggesting a bottom forming in the
us economy,” said lpl financial senior market strategist ryan detrick. “yesterday’s print was one of
several positive economic data surprises we’ve observed recently, bolstering our optimistic view for
economic growth in the second half of the year.”

&gt;
while the economy still has a ways to go in order to recover from the damage of the prior three
months, the composition of may’s lei advance encourages us. we noted a disconnect in april’s readout
in which the financial market indicators tended to be net positive contributors while the “real
economy” indicators detracted. may’s release saw a reversal of that trend whereby the economic
subindexes played catch-up. seven of the 10 components were positive contributors led by an
improvement in average weekly initial unemployment claims, average weekly manufacturing hours, and
building permits. the three negative contributors were the institute for supply management (ism) new
orders index, average consumer expectations for business conditions, and the leading credit
index.

&gt; the most recent lei release reinforces our view that an economic bottom is likely
behind us. workers starting to return to jobs that they were unable to do remotely had material
effects on may’s readout, and if that trend continues, a stock market trading at stretched
valuations would have a stronger foundation under it.

# 3 charts that have our
attention

&gt; stocks have shaken off the 5.9% s&amp;p 500 index drop last thursday by gaining
three days in a row before yesterday’s modest weakness. while researching and reading this week,
three charts stood out that tell us quite a good deal about how investors have reacted during this
volatile market and what could be next.

&gt; “incredibly, we saw nearly a third of all investors
over 65 years old sell their full equity holdings,” explained lpl financial senior market strategist
ryan detrick. “with stocks now back near highs, this is yet another reason to have a plan in place
before trouble comes, as making decisions when under duress can lead to the exact wrong
decision.”

&gt; as shown in the lpl chart of the day, according to data from fidelity investments,
nearly 18% of all investors sold their full equity holdings between february and may, while a much
higher percentage that were closer to retirement (or in retirement) sold. some might have bought
back in, but odds are that many are feeling quite upset with the record bounce back in stocks
here.

&gt;
along these same lines, investors have recently moved to cash at a record pace. in fact, there is
now nearly $5 trillion in money market funds, almost twice the levels we saw this time only five
years ago. also, the past three months saw the largest three-month change ever, as investors ran to
the safety of cash. if you were looking for a reason stocks could continue to go higher over the
longer term, there really is a lot of cash on the sidelines right now.

&gt;
last, we noted last week that the extreme overbought nature of stocks here is actually consistent
with the start of a new bull run, not a bear market bounce, or the end of a bull market. adding to
this, the spread between the number of stocks above their 50-day moving average and 200-day moving
average was near the highest level ever. think about it; with the 45% bounce in the s&amp;p 500,
many stocks were above their 50-day moving average, but not nearly as many were above their 200-day
moving average. so from a longer-term perspective, there could still be gains to be had.

&gt; sure
enough, looking at other times that had wide spreads, they took place near the start of major bull
markets. near-term the potential is there for a well-deserved pullback, but going out 6 to 12
months, stocks have consistently outperformed.

election year july performance tepid

&gt; july historically is the best performing month of the
third quarter however, the mostly negative results in august and september tend to make the
comparison easy. two “hot” julys in 2009 and 2010 where djia and s&amp;p 500 both gained greater
than 6% and a strong performance in 2013 and 2018 have boosted july’s average gains since 1950 to
1.2% and 1.1% respectively. such strength inevitability stirs talk of a “summer rally”, but beware
the hype, as it has historically been the weakest rally of all seasons (page 74, stock trader’s
almanac 2020).

&gt; july begins nasdaq’s worst four months and is the third weakest performing
nasdaq month since 1971, posting a 0.5% average gain. dynamic trading often accompanies the first
full month of summer as the beginning of the second half of the year brings an inflow of new
capital. this creates a bullish beginning, a soft week after options expiration and some strength
towards the end.

&gt;
election year julys rank in the bottom half of all election year months. djia: 0.5%, 6th worst;
s&amp;p 0.4% 6th worst; nasdaq (since 1972): -0.7% 3rd worst; russell 2000 (since 1980): -0.2% 3rd
worst.
