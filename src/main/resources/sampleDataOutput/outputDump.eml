&amp;#x200b;

that

said, some of you here are really motherfucking dense &amp; the sheer influ=
x of retardation has been

driving away some of the more knowledgeable folks on this sub. in fact, in =
my last post, y'all

somehow managed to downvote to shit the few guys that really understood the=
 points i was making and

tried to explain it to you poo-slinging apes. stop that shit yo! a lot of y=
ou need to sit the fuck

down, shut your fucking mouth and listen. =20

so i'm going to try and turn you rag-tag band of

dimwits into a respectable army of peasants that can clap some motherfuckin=
g wall street cheeks.

then, i'm going to give you a mouthbreather-proof trade that i don't think =
even you knuckleheads can

mess up (though i may be underestimating you).=20

if you keep pm-ing me about your stupid ass losses

after this, i will find out where you live and personally, **personally**, =
shit on your

doorstep.

this is going to be a long ass post. read the damned post. i don't care if =
you're

dyslexic, use text-to-speech. got adhd? pop your addys, rub one out, and fo=
cus! are you 12? make

sure to go post in the paper trading contest thread first.

&amp;#x200b;

**the rules:**

1.

understand that most of this sub has the critical reading skills of a 6 yea=
r old and the attention

span of a goldfish. as such, my posts are usually written with a level of d=
etail aimed at the lowest

common denominator. a lot of details on the thesis are omitted, but that do=
esn't mean that the

contents in the post are all there is to it. if i didn't do that, every pos=
t'd have to be longer

than this one, and 98% of you fucks wouldn't read it anyway. fuck that.

2. understand that my style

of making plays is finding the &gt;10+ baggers that are underpriced. as suc=
h, **all the god damn

plays i post are high-risk / high-reward**. only play what you can afford t=
o risk. and stop pm-ing

me the second the market goes the other way, god damn it! if you can't mana=
ge your own positions,

i'm going to teach your ass the basics.

3. do you have no idea what you're doing and have a

question? google it first. then google it again. then bing it, for good mea=
sure. might as well check

pornhub too, you never know. then, if you still didn't find the answer, you=
 ask.

4. this sub gives

me tourette's. if you got a problem with that, well fuck you.=20

&amp;#x200b;

this shit is targeted

at the mouthbreathers, but maybe more knowledgeable folk=E2=80=99ll find so=
me useful info, idk.  how do you

know if you=E2=80=99re in the mouthbreather category? if your answer to any=
 of the following questions is

yes, then you are:

* are you new to trading?
* are you unable to manage your own positions?
* did

you score into the negatives on the sat critical reading section?  =09
* do you think delta is just an

airline?
* do you buy high &amp; sell low?
* do you want to buy garbage like hertz or american

airlines because it's cheap?
* did you buy uso at the bottom and are now proud of yourself for

making $2?
* do you think stonks only go up because fed brrr?=20
* do you think i'm trying to sell you

puts? =09
* if you take a trade you see posted on this sub and are down, do you pm th=
e guy posting

it?
* do you generally pm people on this sub to ask them basic questions? =20
* is your mouth your

primary breathing apparatus?=09 =20
=20

well i have just the thing for

you!

again, in case you haven't heard me the first time. buy $jnk puts now!". st=

**chapter ii. post-mortem of the february - march 2020 great depression**

do

you really understand what happened? let's go through it.

i got in puts on 2/19, right at the

motherfucking top, tqqq at $118. i told you on 2/24 tqqq ($108) was going t=
o shit, and to buy

fucking puts, $90ps, $70ps, $50ps, all the way to 3/20 $30ps. you think i j=
ust pulled that out of my

ass? you think i just keep getting lucky, punks? do you have any idea how u=
nlikely that is?




well, let's take a look at what the fuckstick kevin cook from zacks wrote o=
n 3/5: =20

[how many

sigmas was the flash correction

plunge?](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/many-sigmas-flash-correction-plunge=
-222010752.html)


&gt;"did you know that last week's 14% plunge in the s&amp;p 500 spy was so=
 rare, by statistical=20

measures, that it shouldn't happen once but every 14,000 years?" =20
&gt; =20
&gt;"by several measures,

it was about a 5-sigma move, something that's not "supposed to" happen more=
 than once in your

lifetime -- or your prehistoric ancestors' lifetimes! =20
&gt; =20
&gt;"according to general statistical

principles, a 4-sigma event is to be expected about every 31,560 days, or a=
bout 1 trading day in 126

years. and a 5-sigma event is to be expected every 3,483,046 days, or about=
 1 day every 13,932

years."

&amp;#x200b;

on 3/5, tqqq closed at $81. i just got lucky, right? you should buy after a

5-sigma move, right? that's what fuckstick says:

&gt;"big sigma moves happen all the time in

markets, more than any other field where we collect and analyze historical =
data, because markets are

social beasts subject to "wild randomness" that is not found in the physica=
l sciences. =20
&gt;=20

&gt;this was the primary lesson of nassim taleb's 2007 book the black swan,=
 written before the

financial crisis that found wall street bankers completely ignorant of rand=
omness and the risks of

ruin." =20
&gt; =20
&gt;i also took advantage of the extreme 5-sigma sell-off by grabbing a lev=
eraged

etf on the nasdaq 100, the proshares ultrapro qqq tqqq. in my plan, while i=
 might debate the merits

of buying aapl or msft for hours, i knew i could immediately buy them both =
with tqqq and be rewarded

very quickly after the 14% plunge."

ahahaha, fuckstick bought tqqq at $70, cuz that's what you do

after a random 5-sigma move, right? how many of you dumbasses did the same =
thing? don't lie, i see

you buying 3/5 on this tqqq chart:=20

![img](9ks35zdla5151)

meanwhile, on 3/3, i answered the

question "where do you see this ending up at in the next couple weeks? i ha=
ve 3/20s" with "under 30

imo".

&amp;#x200b;

well good fucking job, because a week later on 3/11, tqqq closed at $61, an=
d it

kept going.

&gt;"the

plunge in us equities yesterday (12 march) pushed weekly returns down to 7.=
7 standard deviations

below the norm. in statistical science, the odds of a greater-than seven-si=

are astronomical to the point of being comical (about one such event every =

years).

let's see what stephen mathai-davis, cfa, cqf, wtf, bbq, founder and ceo of=

&gt; =20
&gt;"so what is the takeaway? i don=E2=80=99t know if now is the right

good job, fuckfaces. y'all bought this one too,

admit it. i see you buying on this chart: =20

![img](s9344geza5151)

well guess what, by 3/18, a

week later, we did get another 5 standard deviation move. tqqq bottomed on =
3/18 at $32.73. still

think that was just luck, punk? you know how many sigmas that was? over 12 =
god-damn sigmas. 12

ach your asses how to

&amp;#x200b;

**chapter iii.

mouthbreather's bootcamp on managing a position =E2=80=93 the technicals**

&amp;#x200b;

**rule 1. you

never buy options at open.** you never overpay for an option. you never fom=
o into buying too fast.

you never ever never pump the premium on a play.

i saw you fuckers buying over 4k tqqq 5/22 $45

puts in the first minutes of trading. you pumped the premium to over $0.50 =
dudes. the play's never

going to work if you do that, because you give the market maker free delta,=
 and he's going to hedge

that against you. let me explain simply:

&amp;#x200b;

let's say a put on ticker $x at strike $50

is worth $1, and a put at strike $51 is worth $2.=20

if you all fomo in at once into the same strike,

the market maker algos will just pull the asks higher. if you overpay at $2=
 for the $50p, the market

maker will just buy $51ps for $2 and sell you $50ps for 2$. or he'll buy lo=
nger-dated $50ps and sell

you shorter-dated $50ps. max risk for him is now 0, max gain is $1. you jus=
t gave him free downside

insurance, so of course he's going to start going long. and you just traded=
 against yourself,

congrats.

&amp;#x200b;

you need to get in with patience, especially if you see other autists here

wanting to go in at the same time. don't step on each other's toes. you put=
 in an order, and you

wait for it to fill for a couple of seconds. if it doesn't fill, and the pr=
ice of the option hasn't

moved much recently, you can bump the bid $0.01. and you keep doing that a =
few times. move your

strikes, if needed. only get a partial fill or don't get a fill at all? you=
 cancel your bid. don't

fucking leave it hanging there, or you're going to put a floor on the price=
. let the mm algos chill

out and go again later.=20

&amp;#x200b;

**rule 2. watch the time**. algos are especially active at

x:00, x:02, x:08, x:12, x:30 and x:58. try not to buy at those times.

**rule 3. you use multiple

brokers.** don't just roll with robinhood, you're just gimping yourself. if=
 you don't have another

one, open up a tasty, ib, td, schwab, whatever. but for cheap faggy puts (o=
r calls), robinhood is

the best. if you want to make a play for which the other side would think "=
that's free money!",

robinhood is the best. because citadel will snag that free money shit like =
no other. seriously, if

you don't have a rh account, open one. it's great for making meme plays.

&amp;#x200b;

**rule 4.

you don't start a trade with big positions.** doesn't matter how big or sma=
ll your bankroll is. if

you go all-in, you're just gambling, and the odds are stacked against you. =
you need to have extra

cash to manage your positions. which leads to

**rule 5. managing your winners**: your position

going for you? good job! now **pound that shit!** and again. move your stri=
kes to cheaper

puts/calls, and pound again. and again. snowball those gains.=20

=20

**rule 6a. pound those $0.01

puts:** =20

so you bought some puts and they=E2=80=99re going down? well, the moment th=
ey reach $0.01, **you

pound those puts** (assuming there=E2=80=99s enough time left on them, not =
shit expiring in 2h). $0.01 puts

have amazing risk/return around the time they reach $0.01. this is not as v=
alid for calls. long

explanation why, but the gist of it is this: you know how calls have unlimi=
ted upside while puts

have limited upside? well it=E2=80=99s the reverse of that.

**rule 6b. managing your losers:**=20

your

position going against you? do you close the position, take your loss porn =
and post it on wsb?

**wrong dumbass**. you manage that by **pounding that shit**. again and aga=
in. you don't manage

losing positions by closing. that removes your gainz when the market turns =
around. you ever close a

position, just to have it turn out it would have been a winner afterwards? =
yeah, don't do that. you

manage it by opening other positions. got puts? buy calls. got calls? buy p=
uts. turn positions into

spreads. buy spreads. buy the vix. sell the vix. they wanna pin for opex? s=
ell them options. not

enough bankroll to sell naked? sell spreads. make them fight you for your m=
oney, motherfuckers,

don't just give it away for free. when you trade, you have the advantage of=
 choosing when and where

to engage. the market can only react. that's your edge, so use it! like thi=
s:

&amp;#x200b;

example

1:=20

initial tqqq 5/22 position =3D $5,000. starts losing? you pound it.


&amp;#x200b;

![img](gq938ty8e5151)

total pounded in 5/22 tqqq puts =3D $10,824. unfortunately

expired worthless (but also goes to show i'm not selling you puts, dickwads=
)

then the autists show

up:

&gt;"hahaha you lost all your money nice job you fucking idiot why do you e=
ven live?" -

/u/cscqb4

wrong fuckface. you see the max pain at spx 2975 &amp; opex pin coming? sel=
l them some

calls or puts (or spreads).=20

&amp;#x200b;

![img](7nv23fr41a151)

sold 9x5/20 spx calls@2975, bam

+$6,390. still wanna pin? well have some 80x5/22 tqqq $80cs, bam anotha

+$14,700.

&amp;#x200b;

![img](1iqtpmc71a151)

\+$21,090 - $10,824 =3D +$10,266 =3D&gt; turned that

shit into a +94.85% gain.=20

&amp;#x200b;

you have a downside

position, but market going up or nowhere? you play that as well. at least m=
ake some money back, if

not profit.=20

&amp;#x200b;

example 2:

&amp;#x200b;

5/22, long weekend coming right? so you use

your brain &amp; try to predict what could happen over the 3-day weekend. h=
mm, 3 day weekend, well

you should expect either a shitty theta-burn or maybe the pajama traders wi=
ll try to pooomp that

shite on the low volume. well make your play. i bet on the shitty theta bur=
n, but could be the

other, idk, so make a small play.=20

&amp;#x200b;

sold some es\_f spreads (for those unaware, es is

a 50x multiplier, so 1 spx =3D 2 es =3D 10 spy, approximately). -47x 2955/2=
960 bear call spreads for

$2.5. max gain is $2.5, max loss is 2960-2955 =3D $5. a double-or-nothing b=
asically. that's $5,875 in

premium, max loss =3D 2x premium =3D $11,750.=20

well, today comes around and futures are pumping. up to

3,014 now. do you just roll over? you think i'm gonna sit and take it up th=
e ass? nah bros that's

not how you trade, you fucking fight them. how?

i have:

47x 2960 calls

\-47x 2955

calls

&amp;#x200b;

pajama traders getting all up in my grill? well then i buy back 1 of the 29=
55

calls. did that shit yesterday when futures were a little over 2980, around=
 2982-ish. paid $34.75,

initially shorted at $16.95, so booked a -$892 loss, for now. but now what =
do i

have?

&amp;#x200b;

46x 2955/2960 bear calls

1x 2960 long call

&amp;#x200b;

so the fuckers can

pump it. in fact, the harder they pump it, the more i make. each $2.5 move =
up in the futures covers

the max loss for 1 spread. with spx now at \~3015, that call is $55 itm. co=
vers 24/46 contracts rn.

if they wanna run it up, at 3070 it's break-even. over that, it's profit. i=
'll sell them some bear

call spreads over 3050 if they run it there too. they gonna dump it? well u=
nder 2960 it's profit

time again. they wanna do a shitty pin at 3000 today? well then i'll sell t=
hem some theta

there.

later edit: that was written yesterday. got out with a loss of only $1.5k o=
ut of the max

$5,875. not bad.

and that, my dudes, is how you manage a position.

&amp;#x200b;

**rule 7

(especially for bears). you don't keep extra cash in your broker account.**=
 you don't do it with

robinhood, because it's a shitty dumpsterfire of a broker. but you don't do=
 it with other brokers

either. pull that shit out. preferably to a bank that doesn't play in the m=
arkets either, use a

credit union or some shit. why? because you're giving the market free liqui=
dity. free margin loans.

squeeze that shit out, make them work for it. your individual cash probably=
 doesn't make a dent, but

a million autists with an extra $1200 trumpbucks means $1.2b. that's starti=
ng to move the needle.

you wanna make a play, use instant deposits. and that way you don't lose yo=
ur shit when your crappy

ass broker or bank gets its ass blown up on derivative trades. even if it's=
 fdic or sipc insured,

it's gonna take time until you see that money again.

**chapter iv.

busting your retarded myths**

&amp;#x200b;

**myth 1 - stonks only go up**

&amp;#x200b;

do you

think the market can go up forever? do you think stonks only go up because =
fed brrr? do you think

spx will be at 5000 by the end of the month? do you think $1.5 trillion is =
a good entry point for

stonks like aapl or msft? do you want to buy garbage like hertz or american=
 airlines because it's

cheap? did you buy uso at the bottom and are now proud of yourself for maki=
ng $2? well, this section

is for you!

let's clear up the misconception that stonks only go up while fed

brrrs.

&amp;#x200b;

what's your target for the spx top? think 3500 by the end of the year? 3500=
 by

september? 4000? 4500? 5000? doesn't matter, you can plug in your own varia=
bles.


&amp;#x200b;

let's say spx only goes up, a moderate 0.5% each period as a compounded avg=
. (i.e.

up a bit down a bit whatever, doesn't matter as long as at the end of your =
period, if you look back

and do the math, you'll get that number). let's call this variable brrr =3D=
 0.005.

&amp;#x200b;

can

you do the basic math to calculate the value at the end of x periods? or di=
d you drop out in 5th

grade? doesn't matter if not, i'll teach you.=20

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

let's say our period is

one week. that is, spx goes up on average 0.5% each week on fed brrr:

2950 \* (1.005\^x), where x

is the number of periods (weeks in this case)

&amp;#x200b;

so, after 1 month, you have: 2950 \*

(1.005\^4) =3D 3009

after 2 months: 2950 \* (1.005\^8) =3D 3070

end of the year? 2950 \* (1.005\^28) =3D

3392

&amp;#x200b;

now clearly, we're already at 3015 on the futures, so we're moving way fast=
er

than that. more like at a speed of brrr =3D 1%/wk

&amp;#x200b;

2950 \* (1.01\^4) =3D 3069

2950 \*

(1.01\^8) =3D 3194

2950 \* (1.01\^28) =3D 3897

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

better, but still slower

than a lot of permabulls would expect. in fact, some legit fucks are seriou=
sly predicting spx

4000-4500 by september. like this dude, david hunter, "contrarian macro str=
ategist w/40+ years on

wall street".

idiotic.

[https://twitter.com/davehcontrarian/status/1263066368414568448](https://tw=
itter.com/davehcontrarian/status/1263066368414568448)

&amp;#x200b;

that'd

be 2950 \* (brrr\^12) =3D 4000 =3D&gt; brrr =3D 1.0257 and 2950 \* (brrr\^1=
2) =3D 4500 =3D&gt; brrr =3D 1.0358,

respectively.=20

&amp;#x200b;

here's why that can't happen, no matter the amount of fed brrr:

**leverage. compounded leverage.**

&amp;#x200b;

there's currently over $100b in leveraged etfs

with a 2.5x avg. leverage. and that's just the ones i managed to tally, the=
re's a lot of dogshit

small ones on top of that. tqqq alone is now at almost $6b in aum (topped i=
n fed at a little over

$7b).

&amp;#x200b;

now, let's try to estimate what happens to tqqq's aum when brrr =3D 1.0257.

3xbrrr =3D 1.0771. take it at 3xbrrr =3D 1.07 to account for slippage in a =
medium-volatility environment

and ignore the fact that the nasdaq-100 would go up more than spx

anyway.

&amp;#x200b;

$6,000,000,000 \* (1.07\^4) =3D $7,864,776,060

$6,000,000,000 \* (1.07\^8) =3D

$10,309,100,000

$6,000,000,000 \* (1.07\^12) =3D $13,513,100,000

$6,000,000,000 \* (1.07\^28) =3D

$39,893,000,000.=20

&amp;#x200b;

what if brrr =3D 1.0358? =3D&gt; 3xbrr =3D 1.1074. take 3xbrrr =3D

1.10.

$6,000,000,000 \* (1.1\^4) =3D $8,784,600,000

$6,000,000,000 \* (1.1\^8) =3D

$12,861,500,000

$6,000,000,000 \* (1.1\^12) =3D $18,830,600,000

$6,000,000,000 \* (1.1\^28) =3D

$86,526,000,000

&amp;#x200b;

and this would have to get 3x leveraged every day. and this is just

for tqqq.

&amp;#x200b;

let's do an estimation for all leveraged funds. $100b aum, 2.5 avg.

leverage factor, brrr =3D 1.0257 =3D&gt; 2.5brrr =3D 1.06425

&amp;#x200b;

$100b \* (1.06\^4) =3D

$128.285b

$100b \* (1.06\^8) =3D $159.385b

$100b \* (1.06\^12) =3D $201.22b

$100b \* (1.06\^28) =3D

$511.169b

&amp;#x200b;

that'd be $1.25 trillion sloshing around each day. and the market would

have to lose each respective amount of cash into these leveraged funds. thi=
nk the market can do

that? you can play around with your own variables. but understand that this=
 is just a small part of

the whole picture, many other factors go into this. it's a way to put a sim=
ple upper limit on an

assumption, to check if it's reasonable.

&amp;#x200b;

in the long run, it doesn't matter if the

fed goes brrr, if tqqq takes in it's share of 3xbrrr. and the fed can't go =
3xbrrr, because then tqqq

would take in 9xbrrr. and on top of this, you have a whole pile of leverage=
d derivatives on top of

these leveraged things. watch (or rewatch) this: [selena gomez &amp; richar=
d h. thaler explaining

synthetic cdo through blackjack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Daum59eh6=
vtw)=20

&amp;#x200b;

my

general point, at the mouth-breather level, is that fed brrr cannot be infi=
nite, because

leverage.

and these leveraged etfs are flawed instruments in the first place. it didn=
't matter when

they started out. tqqq and sqqq started out at $8m each. for the banks prov=
iding the swaps, for the

market providing the futures contracts, whatever counter-party to whatever =
instrument they would

use, that was fine. because it balanced out. when tqqq made a million, sqqq=
 lost a million (minus a

small spread, which was the bank's profit). bank was happy, in the long run=
 things would even out.

slippage and spreads and fees would make them money. but then something hap=
pened. stonks only went

up. and leveraged etfs got bigger and more and more popular.=20

and so, tqqq ended up being $6-7b,

while sqqq was at $1b. and the same goes for all the other etfs. long lever=
aged etf aum became

disproportionate to short aum. and it matters a whole fucking lot. because =
if you think of the

casino, tqqq walks up every day and says "i'd like to put $18b on red", whi=
le sqqq walks up and says

"i'd only like to put $3b on black". and that, in turn, forces the banks pr=
oviding the swaps to

either eat shit with massive losses, or go out and hedge. probably a mix of=
 both. but it doesn't

matter if the banks are hedged, someone else is on the other side of those =
hedges anyway. someone's

eating a loss. can think of it as "the market", in general, eating the loss=
. and there's only so

much loss the market can eat before it craps itself.

&amp;#x200b;

if you were a time traveller,

how much money do you think you could make by trading derivatives? do you t=
hink you could make $20

trillion? you know the future prices after all... but no, you couldn't. the=
re isn't enough money out

there to pay you. so you'd move the markets by blowing them up. call it the=
 time-travelling wsb

autist paradox.=20

&amp;#x200b;

if you had a bucket with a hole in the bottom, even if you poured an

infinite amount of water into it, it would never be full. because there's a=
 **liquidity sink**, just

like there is one in the markets.

and that, my mouth-breathing friends, is the reason why fed brrr

cannot be infinite. or alternatively, "**stonks must go both up and down**"=
.

&amp;#x200b;

**myth 2

- you can't time the market**

&amp;#x200b;

on jan 14, 2020, i predicted this: assuming that corona

doesn't become a problem, "aapl: jan 28 $328.3, jan 31 $316.5, april 1 $365=
.7, may 1 $386, july 1

$429 december 31 $200."

now take a look at the aapl chart in january. after earnings aapl peaked at

$327.85. on 1/31, after the 1st hour of trading, when the big boys make mov=
es, it was at $315.63.

closed 1/31 at $309.51. ya think i pulled this one out of my ass too?=20

yes you can time it. flows,

motherfucker, flows. money flow moves everything. and these days, we have a=
 whole lot of **retarded

flow**. can't even call it dumb flow, because it literally doesn't think. s=
tuff

like:

&amp;#x200b;

* etf flows. if msft goes up and aapl goes down, part of that flow is going=
 to

move from aapl to msft. even if msft flash-crashes up to $1000, the etf wil=
l still "buy". because

it's passive.=20
* option settlement flows. once options expire, money is going to flow from=
 one side

to another, and that my friends is accurately predictable from the data.
* index rebalancing flows
*

buyback flows
* 401k passive flows
* carry trade flows
* tax day flows
* flows of people

front-running the flows

&amp;#x200b;

and many many others. spot the flow, and you get an edge. how

could i predict where aapl would be after earnings within 50 cents and then=
 reverse down to $316 2

days later? **flows motherfucker flows**. the market was so quiet in that p=
eriod, that is was

possible to precisely figure out where it ended up. why the dump after? wel=
l, aapl earnings (the

8-k) come out on a wednesday. the next morning, after market opens the 10-q=
 comes out. and that 10-q

contains a very important nugget of information: the latest number of outst=
anding shares.  but aapl

buybacks are regular as fuck. you can predict the outstanding shares before=
 the market gets the

10-q. and that gives you edge. which leads to

&amp;#x200b;

**myth 3 - buybacks don't matter**


&amp;#x200b;

are you one of those mouthbreathers that parrots the phrase "buybacks are j=
ust a

tax-efficient way to return capital to shareholders"? well sit the fuck dow=
n, i have news for you.

first bit of news, you're dumb as shit. second bit:

&amp;#x200b;

on 1/28, aapl's market cap is

closing\_price x free\_float\_outstanding\_shares. but that's not the real =
market cap. because the

number of outstanding shares is old as fuck. when the latest number comes o=
ut, the market cap

changes instantly. and etfs start moving, and hedges start being changed, a=
nd so on.


&amp;#x200b;

&gt;"but etfs won't change the number of shares they hold, they will still =
hold the

same % of aapl in the index" - /u/random_wsb_autist

&amp;#x200b;

oh my fucking god you're dumb as

fuck. flows change. and the next day, when tqqq comes by and puts its massi=
ve $18b dong on the

table, the market will hedge that differently. and that can be predicted. t=
hat's why aapl was

exactly at $316 1 hour after the market opened on 1/31.=20

&amp;#x200b;

so, what can you use to spot

moves? let me show you:

=20

market topped on 2/19. here=E2=80=99s spy. i even marked interesting dates =
for

you with vertical lines.

&amp;#x200b;

![img](7agm171eh5151)

nobody could have seen it coming,

right? wrong again. here:

&amp;#x200b;

![img](i1kdp3cgh5151)

in fact, jpyusd gave you two whole

days to see it. those are not normal jpyusd moves. but hey maybe it=E2=80=
=99s just a fluke?  wrong again.=20


&amp;#x200b;

![img](fsyhenckh5151)

forex showed you that all over the place. why? flows

motherfucker flows. when everything moves like that, it means the market ne=
eds cash. it doesn=E2=80=99t

matter why, but remember people pulling cash out of atms all over the world=
?  companies drawing

massive revolvers? just understand what this flow means. =20

the reversal:


![img](4xe97l0oh5151)

![img](v6i0pdmoh5151)

but it wasn=E2=80=99t just forex. gold showed it to you as

well. bonds showed it to you as well.

![img](40j53u8th5151)

even god damn buttcoin showed it to

you.

![img](43lvafhvh5151)

and they all did it for 2 days before the move hit equities.=20


&amp;#x200b;

 **chapter v. liquidity nuke inbound**

=20

you see all these bankruptcies that

happened so far, and all the ones that are going to follow? do you think th=
at=E2=80=99s just dogshit

companies and it won=E2=80=99t have major effects on anything outside them?=
 wrong.

because there=E2=80=99s a lot of

leveraged instruments on top of those equities. when the stock goes to 0, a=
ll  those outstanding

puts across all expirations get instantly paid.  =20

understand that feb-march was a liquidity moab.

but this will end with a liquidity nuke. =20

here=E2=80=99s just htz for example: $239,763,550 in outstanding

puts. just on a single dogshit small-cap company (this thing was like $400m=
 mkt. cap last

week).

and that=E2=80=99s just the options on the equity. there=E2=80=99s also ins=
truments on etfs that hold htz,

on the bonds, on the etfs that hold their bonds, swaps, warrants, whatever.=
 it=E2=80=99s a massive pile of

leverage. =20

then there=E2=80=99s also the ripple effects. were you holding a lot of htz=
 in your brokerage

margin  account? well guess what big boi, when that gaps to 0 you get a mar=
gin call, and then you

become a liquidity drain. holding long calls? 0. bonds 0. **dog shit!**

and the market instantly

goes from holding $x in assets (htz equity / bonds / calls) to holding many=
 multiples of x in

liabilities (puts gone wrong, margin loans, derivatives books, revolvers, a=
ll that crap). and it

doesn=E2=80=99t matter if the fed buys crap like htz bonds. you short them =
some. because when it hits 0,

it=E2=80=99s no longer about supply and demand. you get paid full price, st=
raight from jerome=E2=80=99s printer. is

the fed going to buy every blown up derivative too? because that's what the=
y'd have to do.

think of

liquidity as a car. the faster it goes, the harder it becomes to go even fa=
ster. at some point, you

can only go faster by driving off a cliff. the squeeze. but you stop instan=

step 1.  you play

[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D3he2o2fjz-g) full blast. you need =
some real russian hardbass

to get you in the right mood for trading, cyka.

step 2. split your play money in 3. remember to

keep extra bankroll for pounding that shit.

step 3. use 1/3 of your cash to buy sqqq 9/18 $5p, pay

$0.05. not more than $0.10.

step 4. use 1/3 of your cash to buy tqqq 9/18 $20p, pay around $0.45.

alternatively, if you=E2=80=99re feeling adventurous, 7/17 $35p=E2=80=99s f=
or around $0.5.

step 5. use 1/3 of your

cash to buy vix put spreads 9/15 $21/$20 spread for around $0.15, no more t=
han $0.25. that is, you

buy the 21p and sell the 20p. only using robinhood and don=E2=80=99t have t=
he vix? what did i just tell you?

well fine, use uvxy then. just make sure you don=E2=80=99t overpay.

easier to see than with tqqq. aum: 1,174,940,072. add up the value of all t=

1,686,478,417.49  and "net other assets / cash". it should equal the aum, b=

why? because that line should read: net cash =3D -$511,538,344.85

federal reserve chairman jerome powell is expected to reassure markets next=
 week the central bank

will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. that should be enough t=
o keep investors moving

into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the s&amp;p 500 =
into the green for

2020.
*****
&gt; the stock market, so eager to put the entire blow from the pandemic be=
hind it, is

now coming to terms that a =E2=80=9Cv-shaped=E2=80=9D recovery might be too=
 rosy a scenario.=20
*****
&gt; with recent

spikes in coronavirus cases and fluctuations in the economic data, the mark=
et seems to be stuck in a

range amid elevated volatility. market analysts said investors should expec=
t more turbulence ahead

because the economic recovery is most likely to be bumpy.
*****
&gt; =E2=80=9Cthe market was priced for a

continuation of improvement and i think that=E2=80=99s overstating what=E2=

going to have a very slow and uneven improvement in the jobs market.=E2=80=
=9D
*****
&gt; after soaring more

than 40% from the march lows, the s&amp;p 500 turned sideways in the past t=
wo weeks, trading at

similar levels to early june. the market, which used to turn a blind eye to=
 disastrous news on the

thinking that the economy had already bottomed, has become more vulnerable =
to negative economic

headlines as the data begins to give a read on the shape of the recovery.
*****
&gt; stocks came

under pressure earlier this week after data showed weekly jobless claims ro=
se more than expected

last week, and the number stayed above 1 million for the 13th consecutive w=
eek.=20
*****
&gt; and on

the virus front, california, texas, florida and arizona have reported an up=
tick in new infections

and hospitalizations amid the reopening. apple said friday that it=E2=80=99=
s again closing some stores in

florida, north carolina and arizona due to the spikes in coronavirus cases,=
 which sparked a sell-off

in the market, especially among retail stocks.
*****
&gt; =E2=80=9Cthe economy is going to need more help to

bounce back in months to come,=E2=80=9D said matt miskin, co-chief investme=

investment management. =E2=80=9Cfor now, volatility and choppy markets rema=

airlines and delta posted their second straight weekly losses. so did carni=

mgm resorts. those stocks were once the high-beta leaders of the market com=
eback as investors bet

that a successful reopening would take hold.=20
*****
&gt; =E2=80=9Calthough the stock market was suggesting a

v-shaped recovery, the more likely scenario is rolling ws,=E2=80=9D liz ann=
 sonders, chief investment

strategist at charles schwab, said in a note.
*****
&gt; a similar market pattern happened during

the financial crisis, pointed out by nicholas colas, co-founder of datatrek=
 research. after stocks

rallied nearly 40% from the 2009 bottom, the market was range-bound for abo=
ut seven weeks so the

fundamentals could catch up, colas noted.
*****
&gt; from a technical perspective, matthew maley,

chief market strategist at miller tabak, is watching if the s&amp;p 500 can=
 break above its recent

high of 3,232 or drop below the 3,000 threshold or its 200-day moving avera=
ge of 3,018 as of

friday.
*****
&gt; =E2=80=9Cwhichever way it breaks...should be an very important develop=
ment in trying to

=E2=80=9D maley said in a

note.
*****
&gt; # fed can=E2=80=99t prevent volatility
&gt; while the flattening virus curve played a big

role in the market rebound, it=E2=80=99s no denying that the federal reserv=
e=E2=80=99s unprecedented stimulus has

been a key driver in lifting stocks from the coronavirus slump. the central=
 bank unleashed another

weapon in its arsenal this week, saying it will start buying individual cor=
porate bonds.
*****
&gt;

as comforting as it is to have the fed=E2=80=99s support, the central bank =
can only do so much to ease

investor fears.

bell, chief investment strategist at ally invest, said in a note. =E2=80=9C=
it will likely take years for the

economy to fully recover and there remain other uncertainties on the path a=
head. as such, investors

may continue to struggle with this mismatch between markets and the economy=
 before seeing the case

for new highs.=E2=80=9D
*****
&gt; fed chairman jerome powell reminded investors again this week in his

semiannual testimony before congress that =E2=80=9Csignificant uncertainty =
remains about the timing and

strength of the recovery.=E2=80=9D

&gt; many on wall street have also warned that extended policy

measures including injection of trillions of cheap money would lead to prob=

# 100 days

&gt; 100

days ago today on march 11th, the who made it official and declared the cov=
id-19 outbreak a

pandemic. markets were already under a lot of pressure before the who decla=
red the pandemic, but the

100 days since will probably go down as some of the craziest 100 days we'll=
 ever experience, not

only in the market but in general society as well. more than enough ink and=
 pixels have been spent

discussing the societal impact at large, so we'll spare you and just focus =
on the markets.

&gt;

while much of the declines were already in the rearview mirror by the time =
the who made its

announcement, equities still had a steep decline in the immediate aftermath=
. the large-cap russell

1000, for example, fell another 19% to its march 23rd closing low, but afte=
r the rebound, the net

change since the pandemic was officially declared &gt; has been a gain of 1=
4.3%.

&gt; ######

**([click here for the

chart!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061920-russell-100=
0.png))**

&gt; as

impressive as the russell 1000's gain has been in the face of the global pa=
ndemic, many stocks have

done a lot better than that. the table below lists the 25 stocks in the ind=
ex that have seen the

biggest gains so far during this pandemic. topping the list is wayfair (w) =
which has rallied more

than 350%. if there is one thing americans must have realized while they we=
re stuck at home under

lockdown it was that they needed some new furniture! behind wayfair, two ot=
her stocks have more than

tripled and both were beaten down stocks from the energy sector that were t=
rading at less than $2

per share on march 11th. a number of familiar names standout including mode=
rna (mrna), twilio

(twlo), docusign (docu), beyond meat (bynd), and etsy (etsy), but looking t=
hrough the list, there's

really a diverse group of names ranging from bombed-out stocks from the ene=
rgy sector (8 stocks),

consumer names (7 stocks), and the ever-popular software stocks from the te=
chnology sector (6

stocks). it's definitely been a rocky road for the markets over the last 10=
0 days, but for anyone

who had these names in their portfolio, they aren't complaining. click here=

s&amp;p 500 industry group breadth remains positive

&gt; equity markets have become a bit wobbly in

the last week or so, but breadth, in terms of large-cap industry groups, st=
ill remains pretty

robust. relative to their 50-dmas, all 24 s&amp;p 500 industry groups still=
 have rising 50-dmas.

when you consider the fact that the 50-day window spans the period going ba=
ck to early april, a

period encompassing most of what was one of the strongest 50-day rallies on=
 record, the fact that

every industry group has a rising 50-dma isn't all that surprising.

&gt; ###### **([click here for

the chart!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061920-rising-=
50dma.png))**

&gt; even

though all their 50-dmas are rising, not every industry group is currently =
trading above its 50-dma.

while the reading briefly reached 100% in late may and early june, two indu=
stry groups have since

pulled back below their 50-dmas, putting the percentage at a still impressi=
ve 91.7%.

&gt; ######

**([click here for the

chart!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061920-above-50-dm=
a.png))**

&gt; the table

below summarizes industry group performance showing ytd performance, where =
each one is trading

relative to its 50-dma, as well as where the group is trading relative to i=
ts 52-week high.

&gt; as

mentioned above, all but two groups (drugs &amp; biotech and food &amp; sta=
ples retail) remain above

their 50-dmas, and another four are less than 2% above their 50-dma. if fri=
day's sell-off deepens

into next week, the percentage of industry groups above their 50-dmas has t=
he potential to quickly

sink as low as 75%. of the 22 industry groups that are above their 50-dmas,=
 autos and tech hardware

are the only two greater than 10% above.

&gt; on a ytd basis, the s&amp;p 500 is down less than 4%,

but for the vast majority of industry groups, performance has been worse th=
an that. of the 24 groups

shown, 16 are down more than 4% ytd, including eleven that are down over 10=
%. the worst performers

of these losers include energy, banks, and autos. while energy gets most of=
 the attention for being

so weak, banks are essentially down just as much! on the upside, just two i=
ndustry groups are up

over 10% (retailers, which is basically amazon, and software &amp; services=
). retailing is also the

one industry group that is within 1% of a 52-week high and one of seven tha=
t is within 4% of a

52-week high.

credit market reversals

&gt; we've noted in detail the massive reversals seen in global equities

over the last three months, but outside of equities, we've also seen some o=
ther massive moves. one

example is credit spreads between the yields of corporate and high yield bo=
nds relative to

treasuries.

&gt; the top chart below shows the spread in yields between the b of a corp=
orate index

relative to treasuries going back to 1997, and below that, we show the 50-d=
ay rate of change in the

spread. heading into the covid-crash, spreads on corporate bonds were less =
than 100 basis points

(bps), meaning the corporate bond index was yielding only 1 percentage poin=
t more than comparable

treasury yields. in the span of less than two months, though, spreads surge=
d by more than 300 bps to

over 400 bps. not since the depths of the credit crisis in 2009 had we seen=
 spreads widen out more

than they did in march. just as notable as the level is the fact that the s=
peed with which spreads

widened during the covid-crash was similar to the pace during the credit cr=
isis.

&gt; while spreads

were quick to spike during both crises, they narrowed nearly as fast both t=
imes. going back to 1997,

the most corporate spreads have ever narrowed over a 50-day period was in j=
une 2009. coming in at a

close second place, though, the 50-day period ending in early june was near=
ly as extreme.

&gt;

###### **([click here for the

chart!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061820-corporates.=
png))**

&gt; similar to

spreads on corporate bonds, the movement in spreads on high yield (junk) cr=
edit has been nearly as

extreme. while spreads on the b of a high yield master index widened out by=
 only half as much during

the covid-crash as they did during the financial crisis, the 50-day move en=
ding in late march was

easily more extreme than any other period outside of the credit crisis.

&gt; ###### **([click here

for the chart!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061820-hig=
h-yield.png))**

&gt; a

shown in both charts above, the only time both corporate and high yield spr=
eads narrowed by an

amount anywhere close to the amount they narrowed from late march through e=
arly june was back in

early june of 2009. the chart below of the s&amp;p 500 shows that point fro=
m the perspective of the

s&amp;p 500. that period in june 2009 was right in the early stages of what=
 turned out to be a

multi-year bull market. given the similar tightening in the credit market n=
ow versus back then,

should we assume a similar move for equities going forward?

&gt; after the last five months, we'll

be the first to say that anything is possible. however, while there are ple=
nty of similarities

between the moves in credit markets over the last three months versus the f=
irst half of 2009, there

are also important distinctions. the most important of these has to do with=
 where the s&amp;p 500 is

trading right now. the second chart below shows the historical levels the s=
&amp;p 500 has traded at

relative to its all-time high. even after the initial narrowing of credit s=
preads from march through

early june 2009, the s&amp;p 500 was still more than 40% off its all-time h=
ighs, and therefore still

had a lot of climbing to do to get out of the hole. back in june 2009, to g=
et back to its all-time

high from october 2007, the s&amp;p 500 still had to rally another 75%. tod=
ay, it's a much different

picture as the s&amp;p 500 is already within 10% of its february 2020 all-t=
ime high. could we be in

the earlier stages of what turns out to be another long-term bull market? s=
ure. will the magnitude

of the gains be anything like the gains early on in the bull market that be=
gan in 2009? it's

unlikely.

# the very

slow recovery in economic activity is continuing

&gt; as economies around the country slowly

recover from covid-19 and reopenings proceed, economic activity is slowly r=
ecovering. for the

hardest-hit sectors, though, the recovery is only inching forward. security=
 checkpoint volumes at us

airports are still down 80% yoy, and the trend of improvement is only set t=
o return travel activity

to 50% of 2019 levels in september.

&gt; for restaurants, opentable data shows covers down by

two-thirds from last year, though some of that is because many restaurants =
remain closed. among

reopened establishments, the number of seated customers are still down almo=
st 40% yoy. about half of

restaurants remain closed per the opentable data. we discussed this chart a=
nd other retail

enthusiasm indicators in last night's closer report, which is available to =
bespoke institutional

members.

leading indicators turn positive

&gt; yesterday, the conference board released last month=E2=80=99s reading

for its leading economic index (lei), a composite of leading data series, w=
hich showed a

month-over-month increase of 2.8%. as seen in the lpl chart of the day, the=
 return to positive

territory follows three straight months of negative monthly growth.

&gt; =E2=80=9Dwe noted that the pace of

the lei=E2=80=99s deterioration slowed in the april report, potentially sug=
gesting a bottom forming in the

us economy,=E2=80=9D said lpl financial senior market strategist ryan detri=
ck. =E2=80=9Cyesterday=E2=80=99s print was one of

several positive economic data surprises we=E2=80=99ve observed recently, b=
olstering our optimistic view for

economic growth in the second half of the year.=E2=80=9D

&gt;

while the economy still has a ways to go in order to recover from the damag=
e of the prior three

months, the composition of may=E2=80=99s lei advance encourages us. we note=
d a disconnect in april=E2=80=99s readout

in which the financial market indicators tended to be net positive contribu=
tors while the =E2=80=9Creal

economy=E2=80=9D indicators detracted. may=E2=80=99s release saw a reversal=
 of that trend whereby the economic

subindexes played catch-up. seven of the 10 components were positive contri=
butors led by an

improvement in average weekly initial unemployment claims, average weekly m=
anufacturing hours, and

building permits. the three negative contributors were the institute for su=
pply management (ism) new

orders index, average consumer expectations for business conditions, and th=
e leading credit

index.

&gt; the most recent lei release reinforces our view that an economic botto=
m is likely

behind us. workers starting to return to jobs that they were unable to do r=
emotely had material

effects on may=E2=80=99s readout, and if that trend continues, a stock mark=
et trading at stretched

valuations would have a stronger foundation under it.

# 3 charts that have our

attention

&gt; stocks have shaken off the 5.9% s&amp;p 500 index drop last thursday b=
y gaining

three days in a row before yesterday=E2=80=99s modest weakness. while resea=
rching and reading this week,

three charts stood out that tell us quite a good deal about how investors h=
ave reacted during this

volatile market and what could be next.

&gt; =E2=80=9Cincredibly, we saw nearly a third of all investors

over 65 years old sell their full equity holdings,=E2=80=9D explained lpl f=
inancial senior market strategist

ryan detrick. =E2=80=9Cwith stocks now back near highs, this is yet another=
 reason to have a plan in place

before trouble comes, as making decisions when under duress can lead to the=
 exact wrong

decision.=E2=80=9D

&gt; as shown in the lpl chart of the day, according to data from fidelity =
investments,

nearly 18% of all investors sold their full equity holdings between februar=
y and may, while a much

higher percentage that were closer to retirement (or in retirement) sold. s=
ome might have bought

back in, but odds are that many are feeling quite upset with the record bou=
nce back in stocks

here.

0-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=3D1))**

&gt;

along these same lines, investors have recently moved to cash at a record p=
ace. in fact, there is

now nearly $5 trillion in money market funds, almost twice the levels we sa=
w this time only five

years ago. also, the past three months saw the largest three-month change e=
ver, as investors ran to

the safety of cash. if you were looking for a reason stocks could continue =
to go higher over the

longer term, there really is a lot of cash on the sidelines right now.

0-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=3D1))**

&gt;

last, we noted last week that the extreme overbought nature of stocks here =
is actually consistent

with the start of a new bull run, not a bear market bounce, or the end of a=
 bull market. adding to

this, the spread between the number of stocks above their 50-day moving ave=
rage and 200-day moving

average was near the highest level ever. think about it; with the 45% bounc=
e in the s&amp;p 500,

many stocks were above their 50-day moving average, but not nearly as many =
were above their 200-day

moving average. so from a longer-term perspective, there could still be gai=
ns to be had.

&gt; sure

enough, looking at other times that had wide spreads, they took place near =
the start of major bull

markets. near-term the potential is there for a well-deserved pullback, but=
 going out 6 to 12

months, stocks have consistently outperformed.

election year july performance tepid

&gt; july historically is the best performing month of the

third quarter however, the mostly negative results in august and september =
tend to make the

comparison easy. two =E2=80=9Chot=E2=80=9D julys in 2009 and 2010 where dji=
a and s&amp;p 500 both gained greater

than 6% and a strong performance in 2013 and 2018 have boosted july=E2=80=
=99s average gains since 1950 to

1.2% and 1.1% respectively. such strength inevitability stirs talk of a =E2=
=80=9Csummer rally=E2=80=9D, but beware

the hype, as it has historically been the weakest rally of all seasons (pag=
e 74, stock trader=E2=80=99s

almanac 2020).

&gt; july begins nasdaq=E2=80=99s worst four months and is the third weakes=
t performing

nasdaq month since 1971, posting a 0.5% average gain. dynamic trading often=
 accompanies the first

full month of summer as the beginning of the second half of the year brings=
 an inflow of new

capital. this creates a bullish beginning, a soft week after options expira=
tion and some strength

towards the end.

i am looking at ms june '12 $15 puts
some upcoming earnings plays i like: 
*rackspace (rax) which i
am bullish on, especially with the market bringing everything down today. earnings 5/7/12.
*fossil
(fosl) already missed a 5% loss today but i think this is a good name to short going into earnings.
the price in my opinion is too high and retail has been getting beat up lately. i'm looking at puts
for this one with earnings 5/8/12.

i have gs may '12 $110 puts that i am up on, thinking of adding
the $105's after analyzing the chart for a bit. it looks like it could find support around $100
within the next month or two, especially if the sell in may and go away continues.

i have faz may
'12 $24 calls that i plan on holding at least through the next week.

i have tza may '12 $20 calls
(i call these my sell in may and go away options) and i plan on holding these for now as well.

if
oil rallies at all i am most likely going to short it. i have been bearish on oil for months now and
regretfully did not get short the other day at $106 when i knew i should. we are now below $100 and
i think we will be below $90 in no time (look at charts of last summer). 

i think this market is
going to continue trending downward the next 2 months and i will be looking to add onto short
positions. i have been saying the market is going to come down for the last couple months and i
think sell in may and go away is going to help it along. i do not think today was a hiccup, the jobs
report today confirmed what many recent economic reports have been indicating and i think we could
see the dow at 12,000 before long.

so hear me out. i take 250k bring it to ibrokers, they will give me 5x leverage for 1.25% (as i see
them talk about it all day on bloomberg) , i buy 1.25 million dollars of morl. i put in a 10% stop
loss. morl pays 25% dividend, and it pays monthly. my bet would be if it stands up for 9 months.
i'll double my money, take out principal, and let the rest ride. thoughts?
