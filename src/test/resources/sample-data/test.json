In fact, in my last post, y'all somehow managed to downvote to shit the few guys that really understood the points I was making and tried to explain it to you poo-slinging apes. Stop that shit yo! A lot of you need to sit the fuck down, shut your fucking mouth and listen.  \n\nSo I'm going to try and turn you rag-tag band of dimwits into a respectable army of peasants that can clap some motherfucking Wall Street cheeks.

If I didn't do that, every post'd have to be longer than this one, and 98% of you fucks wouldn't read it anyway. Fuck that.\n\n2. Understand that my style of making plays is finding the &gt;10+ baggers that are underpriced. As such, **ALL THE GOD DAMN PLAYS I POST ARE HIGH-RISK / HIGH-REWARD**. Only play what you can afford to risk. And stop PM-ing me the second the market goes the other way, god damn it! If you can't manage your own positions, I'm going to teach your ass the basics.\n\n3. Do you have no idea what you're doing and have a question? Google it first. Then google it again. Then Bing it, for good measure. Might as well check PornHub too, you never know.

I told you on 2/24 TQQQ ($108) was going to shit, and to buy fucking puts, $90ps, $70ps, $50ps, all the way to 3/20 $30ps. You think I just pulled that out of my ass? You think I just keep getting lucky, punks? Do you have any idea how unlikely that is?\n\n \n\nWell, let's take a look at what the fuckstick Kevin Cook from Zacks wrote on 3/5:  \n\n[How Many Sigmas Was the Flash Correction Plunge?](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/many-sigmas-flash-correction-plunge-222010752.html) \n\n&gt;\"Did you know that last week's 14% plunge in the S&amp;P 500 SPY was so rare, by statistical  measures, that it shouldn't happen once but every 14,000 years?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"By several measures, it was about a 5-sigma move, something that's not \"supposed to\" happen more than once in your lifetime -- or your prehistoric ancestors' lifetimes!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"According to general statistical principles, a 4-sigma event is to be expected about every 31,560 days, or about 1 trading day in 126 years. And a 5-sigma event is to be expected every 3,483,046 days, or about 1 day every 13,932 years.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn 3/5, TQQQ closed at $81. I just got lucky, right? You should buy after a 5-sigma move, right? That's what fuckstick says:\n\n&gt;\"Big sigma moves happen all the time in markets, more than any other field where we collect and analyze historical data, because markets are social beasts subject to \"wild randomness\" that is not found in the physical sciences.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This was the primary lesson of Nassim Taleb's 2007 book The Black Swan, written before the financial crisis that found Wall Street bankers completely ignorant of randomness and the risks of ruin.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I also took advantage of the extreme 5-sigma sell-off by grabbing a leveraged ETF on the Nasdaq 100, the ProShares UltraPro QQQ TQQQ. In my plan, while I might debate the merits of buying AAPL or MSFT for hours, I knew I could immediately buy them both with TQQQ and be rewarded very quickly after the 14% plunge.\"\n\nAhahaha, fuckstick bought TQQQ at $70, cuz that's what you do after a random 5-sigma move, right? How many of you dumbasses did the same thing? Don't lie, I see you buying 3/5 on this TQQQ chart: \n\n![img](9ks35zdla5151)\n\nMeanwhile, on 3/3, I answered the question \"Where do you see this ending up at in the next couple weeks? I have 3/20s\" with \"under 30 imo\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell good fucking job, because a week later on 3/11, TQQQ closed at $61, and it kept going.\n\n[Nomura: Market staring into the abyss](https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2020/03/nomura-market-staring-into-the-abyss/) \n\n&gt;\"The plunge in US equities yesterday (12 March) pushed weekly returns down to 7.7 standard deviations below the norm. In statistical science, the odds of a greater-than seven-sigma event of this kind are astronomical to the point of being comical (about one such event every 160 billion years).\n\nLet's see what Stephen Mathai-Davis, CFA, CQF, WTF, BBQ, Founder and CEO of Q.ai - Investing Reimagined, a Forbes Company, and a major fucktard [has to say at this point](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenmathaidavis/2020/03/11/time-to-buy-stocks-selling-otm-put-spreads-looks-better/):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"Our AI models are telling us to buy SPY (the SPDR S&amp;P500 ETF and a great proxy for US large-cap stocks) but since all models are based on past data, does it really make sense? \"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"While it may or may not make sense to buy stocks, it definitely is a good time to sell \u201cvolatility.\u201d And yes, you can do it in your brokerage account! Or, you can ask your personal finance advisor about it.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"So what is the takeaway? I don\u2019t know if now is the right time to start buying stocks again but it sure looks like the probabilities are in your favor to say that we are not going to experience another 7 standard deviation move in U.S. Stocks. OTM (out-of-the-money) Put Spreads are a great way to get some bullish exposure to a rally in the SPY while also shorting such rich volatility levels.\"\n\nGood job, fuckfaces. Y'all bought this one too, admit it. I see you buying on this chart:  \n \n\n![img](s9344geza5151)\n\nWell guess what, by 3/18, a week later, we did get another 5 standard deviation move. TQQQ bottomed on 3/18 at $32.73. Still think that was just luck, punk? You know how many sigmas that was? Over 12 god-damn sigmas. 12 standard deviations. I'd have a much better chance of guessing everyone's buttcoin private key, in a row, on the first try. That's how unlikely that is.\n\n![img](luz0s3kbb5151)\n\n \n\n&gt;\"Hurr durr you said it's going to 0, so you're retarded because it didn't go to 0\" - /u/random_wsb_autist\n\nYeah, fuckface, because the Fed bailed \u2018em out. Remember the $150b \u201covernight repo\u201d bazooka on 3/17? That\u2019s what that was, a bailout.

It seems Citadel is \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d.  On 3/18, the payout on 3/20 TQQQ puts alone if it went to 0 was $468m. And every single TQQQ put expiration would have had to be paid.

No, dumbass, you try to figure out what Billy's doing. And in this case it was pretty obvious, Billy saw the Fed train coming and wanted to close his shorts. So you give the dude a hand, quick short in and out, and position for Billy dumping his short bags.  \n\n[Video of Billy &amp; the Fed train](https://giphy.com/gifs/cheezburger-fail-train-near-miss-l2Sq3kNYfshvzwoBq)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's what Billy boy says:\n\n&gt;\u201cBut if they don\u2019t, and the government takes the right steps, this hedge could be worth zero, and the stock market could go right back up to where it was.

I gave y\u2019all a 150-bagger.  \n\nSo how could I catch that? Because it wasn't random, yo. And I'm here to teach your asses how to try to spot such potential moves. But first, the technical bootcamp.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Chapter III. Mouthbreather's bootcamp on managing a position \u2013 THE TECHNICALS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RULE 1. YOU NEVER BUY OPTIONS AT OPEN.** You NEVER OVERPAY for an option. You never FOMO into buying too fast. You NEVER EVER NEVER pump the premium on a play.\n\nI saw you fuckers buying over 4k TQQQ 5/22 $45 puts in the first minutes of trading. You pumped the premium to over $0.50 dudes. The play's never going to work if you do that, because you give the market maker free delta, and he's going to hedge that against you. Let me explain simply:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's say a put on ticker $X at strike $50 is worth $1, and a put at strike $51 is worth $2. \n\nIf you all fomo in at once into the same strike, the market maker algos will just pull the asks higher. If you overpay at $2 for the $50p, the market maker will just buy $51ps for $2 and sell you $50ps for 2$. Or he'll buy longer-dated $50ps and sell you shorter-dated $50ps. Max risk for him is now 0, max gain is $1. You just gave him free downside insurance, so of course he's going to start going long. And you just traded against yourself, congrats.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou need to get in with patience, especially if you see other autists here wanting to go in at the same time. Don't step on each other's toes. You put in an order, and you wait for it to fill for a couple of seconds. If it doesn't fill, AND the price of the option hasn't moved much recently, you can bump the bid $0.01. And you keep doing that a few times. Move your strikes, if needed. Only get a partial fill or don't get a fill at all? You cancel your bid. Don't fucking leave it hanging there, or you're going to put a floor on the price. Let the mm algos chill out and go again later. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RULE 2. WATCH THE TIME**. Algos are especially active at x:00, x:02, x:08, x:12, x:30 and x:58. Try not to buy at those times.\n\n**RULE 3. YOU USE MULTIPLE BROKERS.** Don't just roll with Robinhood, you're just gimping yourself. If you don't have another one, open up a tasty, IB, TD, Schwab, whatever. But for cheap faggy puts (or calls), Robinhood is the best. If you want to make a play for which the other side would think \"That's free money!\", Robinhood is the best. Because Citadel will snag that free money shit like no other. Seriously, if you don't have a RH account, open one. It's great for making meme plays.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RULE 4. YOU DON'T START A TRADE WITH BIG POSITIONS.** Doesn't matter how big or small your bankroll is. If you go all-in, you're just gambling, and the odds are stacked against you. You need to have extra cash to manage your positions. Which leads to\n\n**RULE 5. MANAGING YOUR WINNERS**: Your position going for you? Good job! Now **POUND THAT SHIT!** And again. Move your strikes to cheaper puts/calls, and pound again. And again. Snowball those gains. \n\n \n\n**RULE 6A. POUND THOSE $0.01 PUTS:**  \n\nSo you bought some puts and they\u2019re going down? Well, the moment they reach $0.01, **YOU POUND THOSE PUTS** (assuming there\u2019s enough time left on them, not shit expiring in 2h). $0.01 puts have amazing risk/return around the time they reach $0.01. This is not as valid for calls. Long explanation why, but the gist of it is this: you know how calls have unlimited upside while puts have limited upside? Well it\u2019s the reverse of that.\n\n**RULE 6B. MANAGING YOUR LOSERS:** \n\nYour position going against you? Do you close the position, take your loss porn and post it on wsb? **WRONG DUMBASS**. You manage that by **POUNDING THAT SHIT**. Again and again. You don't manage losing positions by closing. That removes your gainz when the market turns around. You ever close a position, just to have it turn out it would have been a winner afterwards? Yeah, don't do that. You manage it by opening other positions. Got puts? Buy calls. Got calls? Buy puts. Turn positions into spreads. Buy spreads. Buy the VIX. Sell the VIX. They wanna pin for OPEX? Sell them options. Not enough bankroll to sell naked? Sell spreads. Make them fight you for your money, motherfuckers, don't just give it away for free. When you trade, YOU have the advantage of choosing when and where to engage. The market can only react. That's your edge, so USE IT! Like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExample 1: \n\nInitial TQQQ 5/22 position = $5,000. Starts losing? You pound it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](gq938ty8e5151)\n\nTotal pounded in 5/22 TQQQ puts = $10,824. Unfortunately expired worthless (but also goes to show I'm not selling you puts, dickwads)\n\nThen the autists show up:\n\n&gt;\"Hahaha you lost all your money nice job you fucking idiot why do you even live?\" - /u/cscqb4\n\nWrong fuckface. You see the max pain at SPX 2975 &amp; OPEX pin coming? Sell them some calls or puts (or spreads). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](7nv23fr41a151)\n\nSold 9x5/20 SPX calls@2975, bam +$6,390. Still wanna pin? Well have some 80x5/22 TQQQ $80cs, bam anotha +$14,700.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](1iqtpmc71a151)\n\n\\+$21,090 - $10,824 = +$10,266 =&gt; Turned that shit into a +94.85% gain. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;[./u/cscqb4 rn](https://giphy.com/gifs/smile-angry-kanye-west-ZI88V08ZzgMWA) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have a downside position, but market going up or nowhere? You play that as well. At least make some money back, if not profit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExample 2:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5/22, long weekend coming right? So you use your brain &amp; try to predict what could happen over the 3-day weekend. Hmm, 3 day weekend, well you should expect either a shitty theta-burn or maybe the pajama traders will try to pooomp that shite on the low volume. Well make your play. I bet on the shitty theta burn, but could be the other, idk, so make a small play. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSold some ES\\_F spreads (for those unaware, ES is a 50x multiplier, so 1 SPX = 2 ES = 10 SPY, approximately). -47x 2955/2960 bear call spreads for $2.5. Max gain is $2.5, max loss is 2960-2955 = $5. A double-or-nothing basically. That's $5,875 in premium, max loss = 2x premium = $11,750. \n\nWell, today comes around and futures are pumping. Up to 3,014 now. Do you just roll over? You think I'm gonna sit and take it up the ass? Nah bros that's not how you trade, you fucking fight them. How?\n\nI have:\n\n47x 2960 calls\n\n\\-47x 2955 calls\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPajama traders getting all up in my grill? Well then I buy back 1 of the 2955 calls. Did that shit yesterday when futures were a little over 2980, around 2982-ish. Paid $34.75, initially shorted at $16.95, so booked a -$892 loss, for now. But now what do I have?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n46x 2955/2960 bear calls\n\n1x 2960 long call\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the fuckers can pump it. In fact, the harder they pump it, the more I make. Each $2.5 move up in the futures covers the max loss for 1 spread. With SPX now at \\~3015, that call is $55 ITM. Covers 24/46 contracts rn. If they wanna run it up, at 3070 it's break-even. Over that, it's profit. I'll sell them some bear call spreads over 3050 if they run it there too. They gonna dump it? well under 2960 it's profit time again. They wanna do a shitty pin at 3000 today? Well then I'll sell them some theta there.\n\nLater edit: that was written yesterday. Got out with a loss of only $1.5k out of the max $5,875. Not bad.\n\nAnd that, my dudes, is how you manage a position.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RULE 7 (ESPECIALLY FOR BEARS). YOU DON'T KEEP EXTRA CASH IN YOUR BROKER ACCOUNT.** You don't do it with Robinhood, because it's a shitty dumpsterfire of a broker. But you don't do it with other brokers either. Pull that shit out. Preferably to a bank that doesn't play in the markets either, use a credit union or some shit. Why? Because you're giving the market free liquidity. Free margin loans. Squeeze that shit out, make them work for it. Your individual cash probably doesn't make a dent, but a million autists with an extra $1200 trumpbucks means $1.2b. That's starting to move the needle. You wanna make a play, use instant deposits. And that way you don't lose your shit when your crappy ass broker or bank gets its ass blown up on derivative trades. Even if it's FDIC or SIPC insured, it's gonna take time until you see that money again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Chapter IV. BUSTING YOUR RETARDED MYTHS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MYTH 1 - STONKS ONLY GO UP**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you think the market can go up forever? Do you think stOnKs oNLy Go uP because Fed brrr? Do you think SPX will be at 5000 by the end of the month? Do you think $1.5 trillion is a good entry point for stonks like AAPL or MSFT? Do you want to buy garbage like Hertz or American Airlines because it's cheap? Did you buy USO at the bottom and are now proud of yourself for making $2? Well, this section is for you!\n\nLet's clear up the misconception that stonks only go up while Fed brrrs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat's your target for the SPX top? Think 3500 by the end of the year? 3500 by September? 4000? 4500? 5000? Doesn't matter, you can plug in your own variables. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's say SPX only goes up, a moderate 0.5% each period as a compounded avg. (i.e. up a bit down a bit whatever, doesn't matter as long as at the end of your period, if you look back and do the math, you'll get that number). Let's call this variable BRRR = 0.005.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan you do the basic math to calculate the value at the end of x periods? Or did you drop out in 5th grade? Doesn't matter if not, I'll teach you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's say our period is one week. That is, SPX goes up on average 0.5% each week on Fed BRRR:\n\n2950 \\* (1.005\\^x), where x is the number of periods (weeks in this case)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, after 1 month, you have: 2950 \\* (1.005\\^4) = 3009\n\nAfter 2 months: 2950 \\* (1.005\\^8) = 3070\n\nEnd of the year? 2950 \\* (1.005\\^28) = 3392\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow clearly, we're already at 3015 on the futures, so we're moving way faster than that. More like at a speed of BRRR = 1%/wk\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2950 \\* (1.01\\^4) = 3069\n\n2950 \\* (1.01\\^8) = 3194\n\n2950 \\* (1.01\\^28) = 3897\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBetter, but still slower than a lot of permabulls would expect. In fact, some legit fucks are seriously predicting SPX 4000-4500 by September. Like this dude, David Hunter, \"Contrarian Macro Strategist w/40+ years on Wall Street\". IDIOTIC.\n\n[https://twitter.com/DaveHcontrarian/status/1263066368414568448](https://twitter.com/DaveHcontrarian/status/1263066368414568448)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat'd be 2950 \\* (BRRR\\^12) = 4000 =&gt; BRRR = 1.0257 and 2950 \\* (BRRR\\^12) = 4500 =&gt; BRRR = 1.0358, respectively. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's why that can't happen, no matter the amount of FED BRRR: **Leverage. Compounded Leverage.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's currently over $100b in leveraged etfs with a 2.5x avg. leverage. And that's just the ones I managed to tally, there's a lot of dogshit small ones on top of that. TQQQ alone is now at almost $6b in AUM (topped in Fed at a little over $7b).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, let's try to estimate what happens to TQQQ's AUM when BRRR = 1.0257. 3XBRRR = 1.0771. Take it at 3XBRRR = 1.07 to account for slippage in a medium-volatility environment and ignore the fact that the Nasdaq-100 would go up more than SPX anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$6,000,000,000 \\* (1.07\\^4) = $7,864,776,060\n\n$6,000,000,000 \\* (1.07\\^8) = $10,309,100,000\n\n$6,000,000,000 \\* (1.07\\^12) = $13,513,100,000\n\n$6,000,000,000 \\* (1.07\\^28) = $39,893,000,000. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat if BRRR = 1.0358? =&gt; 3XBRR = 1.1074. Take 3XBRRR = 1.10.\n\n$6,000,000,000 \\* (1.1\\^4) = $8,784,600,000\n\n$6,000,000,000 \\* (1.1\\^8) = $12,861,500,000\n\n$6,000,000,000 \\* (1.1\\^12) = $18,830,600,000\n\n$6,000,000,000 \\* (1.1\\^28) = $86,526,000,000\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd this would have to get 3x leveraged every day. And this is just for TQQQ.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's do an estimation for all leveraged funds. $100b AUM, 2.5 avg. leverage factor, BRRR = 1.0257 =&gt; 2.5BRRR = 1.06425\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$100b \\* (1.06\\^4) = $128.285b\n\n$100b \\* (1.06\\^8) = $159.385b\n\n$100b \\* (1.06\\^12) = $201.22b\n\n$100b \\* (1.06\\^28) = $511.169b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat'd be $1.25 trillion sloshing around each day. And the market would have to lose each respective amount of cash into these leveraged funds. Think the market can do that? You can play around with your own variables. But understand that this is just a small part of the whole picture, many other factors go into this. It's a way to put a simple upper limit on an assumption, to check if it's reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the long run, it doesn't matter if the Fed goes BRRR, if TQQQ takes in it's share of 3XBRRR. And the Fed can't go 3XBRRR, because then TQQQ would take in 9XBRRR. And on top of this, you have a whole pile of leveraged derivatives on top of these leveraged things. Watch (or rewatch) this: [Selena Gomez &amp; Richard H. Thaler Explaining Synthetic CDO through BLACKJACK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUM59Eh6vTw) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy general point, at the mouth-breather level, is that Fed BRRR cannot be infinite, because leverage.\n\nAnd these leveraged ETFs are flawed instruments in the first place. It didn't matter when they started out. TQQQ and SQQQ started out at $8m each. For the banks providing the swaps, for the market providing the futures contracts, whatever counter-party to whatever instrument they would use, that was fine. Because it balanced out. When TQQQ made a million, SQQQ lost a million (minus a small spread, which was the bank's profit). Bank was happy, in the long run things would even out. Slippage and spreads and fees would make them money. But then something happened. Stonks only went up. And leveraged ETFs got bigger and more and more popular. \n\nAnd so, TQQQ ended up being $6-7b, while SQQQ was at $1b. And the same goes for all the other ETFs. Long leveraged ETF AUM became disproportionate to short AUM. And it matters a whole fucking lot. Because if you think of the casino, TQQQ walks up every day and says \"I'd like to put $18b on red\", while SQQQ walks up and says \"I'd only like to put $3b on black\". And that, in turn, forces the banks providing the swaps to either eat shit with massive losses, or go out and hedge. Probably a mix of both. But it doesn't matter if the banks are hedged, someone else is on the other side of those hedges anyway. Someone's eating a loss. Can think of it as \"The Market\", in general, eating the loss. And there's only so much loss the market can eat before it craps itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you were a time traveller, how much money do you think you could make by trading derivatives? Do you think you could make $20 trillion? You know the future prices after all... But no, you couldn't. There isn't enough money out there to pay you. So you'd move the markets by blowing them up. Call it the Time-travelling WSB Autist Paradox. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you had a bucket with a hole in the bottom, even if you poured an infinite amount of water into it, it would never be full. Because there's a **LIQUIDITY SINK**, just like there is one in the markets.\n\nAnd that, my mouth-breathing friends, is the reason why FED BRRR cannot be infinite. Or alternatively, \"**STONKS MUST GO BOTH UP AND DOWN**\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MYTH 2 - YOU CAN'T TIME THE MARKET**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Jan 14, 2020, I predicted this: Assuming that corona doesn't become a problem, \"AAPL: Jan 28 $328.3, Jan 31 $316.5, April 1 $365.7, May 1 $386, July 1 $429 December 31 $200.\"\n\nNow take a look at the AAPL chart in January. After earnings AAPL peaked at $327.85. On 1/31, after the 1st hour of trading, when the big boys make moves, it was at $315.63. Closed 1/31 at $309.51. Ya think I pulled this one out of my ass too? \n\nYes you can time it. Flows, motherfucker, flows. Money flow moves everything. And these days, we have a whole lot of **RETARDED FLOW**. Can't even call it dumb flow, because it literally doesn't think. Stuff like:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* ETF flows. If MSFT goes up and AAPL goes down, part of that flow is going to move from AAPL to MSFT. Even if MSFT flash-crashes up to $1000, the ETF will still \"buy\". Because it's passive. \n* Option settlement flows. Once options expire, money is going to flow from one side to another, and that my friends is accurately predictable from the data.\n* Index rebalancing flows\n* Buyback flows\n* 401k passive flows\n* Carry trade flows\n* Tax day flows\n* Flows of people front-running the flows\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd many many others. Spot the flow, and you get an edge. How could I predict where AAPL would be after earnings within 50 cents and then reverse down to $316 2 days later? **FLOWS MOTHERFUCKER FLOWS**. The market was so quiet in that period, that is was possible to precisely figure out where it ended up. Why the dump after? Well, AAPL earnings (The 8-K) come out on a Wednesday. The next morning, after market opens the 10-Q comes out. And that 10-Q contains a very important nugget of information: the latest number of outstanding shares.  But AAPL buybacks are regular as fuck. You can predict the outstanding shares before the market gets the 10-Q. And that gives you EDGE. Which leads to\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MYTH 3 - BUYBACKS DON'T MATTER** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre you one of those mouthbreathers that parrots the phrase \"buybacks are just a tax-efficient way to return capital to shareholders\"? Well sit the fuck down, I have news for you. First bit of news, you're dumb as shit. Second bit:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn 1/28, AAPL's market cap is closing\\_price x free\\_float\\_outstanding\\_shares. But that's not the REAL MARKET CAP. Because the number of outstanding shares is OLD AS FUCK. When the latest number comes out, the market cap changes instantly. And ETFs start moving, and hedges start being changed, and so on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"But ETFs won't change the number of shares they hold, they will still hold the same % of AAPL in the index\" - /u/random_wsb_autist\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh my fucking god you're dumb as fuck. FLOWS change. And the next day, when TQQQ comes by and puts its massive $18b dong on the table, the market will hedge that differently. And THAT CAN BE PREDICTED. That's why AAPL was exactly at $316 1 hour after the market opened on 1/31. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what can you use to spot moves? Let me show you:\n\n \n\nMarket topped on 2/19. Here\u2019s SPY. I even marked interesting dates for you with vertical lines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](7agm171eh5151)\n\nNobody could have seen it coming, right? WRONG AGAIN. Here:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](i1kdp3cgh5151)\n\nIn fact, JPYUSD gave you two whole days to see it. Those are NOT normal JPYUSD moves. But hey maybe it\u2019s just a fluke?  Wrong again.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](fsyhenckh5151)\n\nForex showed you that all over the place. Why? FLOWS MOTHERFUCKER FLOWS. When everything moves like that, it means the market needs CASH. It doesn\u2019t matter why, but remember people pulling cash out of ATMs all over the world?  Companies drawing massive revolvers? Just understand what this flow means.  \n\nThe reversal: \n\n![img](4xe97l0oh5151)\n\n![img](v6i0pdmoh5151)\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just forex. Gold showed it to you as well. Bonds showed it to you as well.\n\n![img](40j53u8th5151)\n\nEven god damn buttcoin showed it to you.\n\n![img](43lvafhvh5151)\n\nAnd they all did it for 2 days before the move hit equities.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **Chapter V. LIQUIDITY NUKE INBOUND**\n\n \n\nYou see all these bankruptcies that happened so far, and all the ones that are going to follow? Do you think that\u2019s just dogshit companies and it won\u2019t have major effects on anything outside them? WRONG.\n\nBecause there\u2019s a lot of leveraged instruments on top of those equities. When the stock goes to 0, all  those outstanding puts across all expirations get instantly paid.   \n\nUnderstand that Feb-March was a liquidity MOAB. But this will end with a liquidity nuke.  \n\nHere\u2019s just HTZ for example: $239,763,550 in outstanding puts. Just on a single dogshit small-cap company (this thing was like $400m mkt. cap last week).\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the options on the equity. There\u2019s also instruments on etfs that hold HTZ, on the bonds, on the ETFs that hold their bonds, swaps, warrants, whatever. It\u2019s a massive pile of leverage.  \n\nThen there\u2019s also the ripple effects. Were you holding a lot of HTZ in your brokerage margin  account? Well guess what big boi, when that gaps to 0 you get a margin call, and then you become a liquidity drain. Holding long calls? 0. Bonds 0. **DOG SHIT!**\n\nAnd the market instantly goes from holding $x in assets (HTZ equity / bonds / calls) to holding many multiples of x in LIABILITIES (puts gone wrong, margin loans, derivatives books, revolvers, all that crap). And it doesn\u2019t matter if the Fed buys crap like HTZ bonds. You short them some. Because when it hits 0, it\u2019s no longer about supply and demand. You get paid full price, straight from Jerome\u2019s printer. Is the Fed going to buy every blown up derivative too? Because that's what they'd have to do.\n\nThink of liquidity as a car. The faster it goes, the harder it becomes to go even faster. At some point, you can only go faster by driving off a cliff. THE SQUEEZE. But you stop instantly when you hit the ground eventually. And that\u2019s what shit\u2019s doing all over the place right now.\n\nRewatch: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hG4X5iTK8M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hG4X5iTK8M)\n\nAnd just like that fucker, \u201cI\u2019m standing in front of a burning house, and I\u2019m offering you fire insurance on it.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Don\u2019t baghold!**\n\nNow is not the time to baghold junk. Take your cash. Not the time to buy cheap crap. You don\u2019t buy Hertz. You don\u2019t buy USO. You don\u2019t buy airlines, or cruises, or GE, or motherfucking Disney. And if you have it, dump that shit.  \n\nAnd the other dogshit that\u2019s at ATH, congrats you\u2019re in the green. Now you take your profits and fucking dump that shit. I\u2019m talking shit like garbage SaaS, app shit, AI shit, etc. Garbage like MDB, OKTA, SNAP, TWLO, ZM, CHGG etc.\n\nAnd you dump those garbage ass leveraged ETFs. SQQQ, TQQQ, whatever, they\u2019re all dogshit now.  \n\nThe leverage MUST unwind. And once that\u2019s done, some of you will no longer be among us if you don\u2019t listen. A lot of leveraged ETFs will be gone. Even some non-leveraged ETFs will be gone. Some brokers will be gone, some market makers will be gone, hell maybe even some big bank has to go under. I can\u2019t know which ones will go poof, but I can guarantee you that some will. Another reason to diversify your shit. There\u2019s a reason papa Warrant Buffet dumped his bags, don\u2019t think you\u2019re smarter than him. He may be senile, but he\u2019s still a snake.\n\nAnd once the unwind is done, THEN you buy whatever cheap dogshit\u2019s still standing.  \n\nGot it? Good.\n\nYou feel ready to play yet?  Alright, so you catch a move. Or I post a move and you wanna play it. You put on a small position. When it\u2019s going your way, **YOU POUND DAT SHIT.** Still going?

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 4th, 2019.\n\n# **It\u2019s getting to be the best time of year for stocks, and the Dow could soon set a new high  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/the-dow-could-soon-join-other-benchmarks-at-a-record-as-strong-november-seasonality-kicks-in.html)**\n*****\n&gt; As November unfolds, stocks should continue to make gains in one of the best months of the year for the market, and it\u2019s very likely the Dow will soon join other indexes in setting new highs.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both traded in record territory in the past trading week, boosted by some better economic news, a better-than-expected earnings season, and hopes that trade talks will soon lead to a first-phase deal between the U.S. and China. On Friday, China said it reached a consensus with the U.S. in principle after a phone call among high-level negotiators.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say stocks could follow the seasonal trends higher, barring problems in trade talks. The market is starting the best three months of the year historically, and it has a few catalysts in the week ahead. There are a number of economic reports, the most important of which will be the ISM services PMI on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Third-quarter earnings season continues, with about 80 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting, including media companies Disney and News Corp. and chipmaker Qualcomm.\n*****\n&gt; # Top months ahead for stocks\n&gt; November is the third-best month for the S&amp;P 500, which has been higher two-thirds of the time since World War II with an average 1.3% gain, according to CFRA. As good as November has been, December is even better, and as the No. 1 month, it is up 76% of the time with an average 1.6% gain. November, however, is the month that has seen the most new highs for the S&amp;P, on a percentage basis, according to CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cInvestors likely remain too skeptical on the impact of Brexit, the U.S.-China trade talks and the impeachment hearings. They\u2019re too skeptical that the market can advance,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Many strategists say the efforts by Democrats to impeach Trump is not hurting stock prices currently but it could if there are any developments that would put his re-election in doubt.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think November and December are pretty much going to buck the emotional trend right now. The market is telling us it wants to go higher,\u201d Stovall said.\n*****\n&gt; Of the more than 350 S&amp;P companies that have reported earnings, 76% beat earnings estimates, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Earnings are down about 0.8% for the quarter, based on companies that have reported already and estimates.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis will be the 31st consecutive quarter in which actuals exceed estimates, but as much as earnings are coming in better for the quarter, they\u2019re going down in terms of Q4 and 2020. That\u2019s not good,\u201d said Stovall. But he said stocks could be lifted by the end of the trade war, the impact of lowered interest rates and a possible tax cut from the White House.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think because the market is doing so well, it might be telling us we\u2019re underestimating forward growth. Prices lead fundamentals,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P and Nasdaq soared into record territory Friday after the October jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls grew by 128,000, much greater than expected. The number was weaker due to the strike against General Motors but not as weak as feared.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed also added to positive sentiment with a rate cut on Wednesday, but the central bank went out of its way to signal a pause in policy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe rally is definitely broadening out. The measured move is 3,200 on the S&amp;P 500 by year-end. In the last two sessions, we retested and spent some time above the 3,025 area. Today\u2019s move showed some needed power, after a jobs report that was Goldilocks: It had something for everyone, not too strong to have the Fed as a headwind but strong enough to keep recession fears away,\u201d said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. \u201cToday\u2019s move lends some power to the bulls.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Redler said Apple\u2019s performance this week was a big boost to sentiment. It ended the week up 3.7%, at a new all-time high, after strong earnings. \u201cTraders love when Apple leads the way,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was higher for a fourth week in a row, its longest winning streak since March. The S&amp;P ended the week at 3,066, up 1.5% for the week, while the Nasdaq closed at a record 8,386, up 1.7% for the week. The Dow gained 1.4% for the week, lifted by a 301-point bounce Friday. It finished the week at 27,347, 0.2% below its all-time high of 27,398.\n*****\n&gt; Historically, industrials have had the best gains on average in November, going back to 1995. Industrial stocks have been up an average 2.9%, followed by materials, up 2.7%, consumer discretionary, up 2.6% and then technology, up 2.4%, according to CFRA data.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe cliche thing is everyone is focused on the breakout. I think the key technical event that\u2019s been developing for weeks, it\u2019s really been this rotation toward cyclicals,\u201d said Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at Fundstrat.\n*****\n&gt; He said he expects the Dow to break to new highs soon. \u201cWe think the market is strong through year end and well into 2020. We continue to think the market cycle low developed in late 2018. This is the next leg up in the bull market,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # What are bonds saying?\n&gt; The bond market did not respond in the same way as stocks to the jobs number. Yields were slightly higher Friday but remained near or below the level they were at just prior to the Fed rate cut on Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re actually down on the week. That tells you what the bond market thinks about the economic landscape, particularly with the jobs report. I know there\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm about it,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cThe bond market continues to send a very different message than the optimism in the equities market. The pace of job growth is still slowing, and this number is going to get revised multiple times. Everything is pointing to a slowdown in growth.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.73% Friday afternoon, and it had been at 1.80% at the end of the prior week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a bit of moderation from the sell-off we saw last week. The Fed was pretty much in line with what people were expecting,\u201d said Ben Jeffery, a rate strategist at BMO. \u201cI think probably stocks are viewing it as the Fed is comfortable leaving rates on hold, so many recessionary fears are a bit overblown. You could make the argument the bond market is less convinced about that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; However, Stovall said it\u2019s a positive for stocks when the yield on the 10-year is lower than the yield on the S&amp;P 500, now about 2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI would say another positive for stocks is historically when the dividend yield on the S&amp;P 500 has exceeded the yield on the 10-year note. The average 12-month return for the S&amp;P has exceeded 22%,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fMSMfhh.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Zk6ZCDD.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/Ory2tKZ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/vDtIzbr.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kgoXJ3b.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xE5ngtV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/z6KfVTK.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ohfhFMl.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/aw5n74R.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/c6iyCwq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZLfqEJs.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4lgiA2G.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/PgvRk8F.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zKsPBmS.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/nnvJEBa.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical November Trading: First Month of \u201cBest Months\u201d\n\n&gt; November\u2019s long-term track record has been stellar. It is the number one month of the year for S&amp;P 500 since 1950 with an average gain of 1.6%, up 47 times in 69 years. DJIA\u2019s record matches S&amp;P 500, up 47 of 69 with an average gain of 1.6% although November is DJIA\u2019s second best month. NASDAQ also averages a 1.6% gain in November (second best), up 33 times in 48 years (since 1971).\n\n&gt; Over the more recent 21-year period, 1998 to 2018, November\u2019s average performance has remained solid. November has opened well with gains during the first four or five trading days depending on index. From there trading has become rather choppy with gains receding through mid-month before a low around the fourteenth trading day. At which point bullish holiday spirit has kicked in around Thanksgiving propelling all indexes to a strong rally to finish the month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b9faf85e2a54e356f1c29214261f03fa/bc2631ef216e46d9-31/s500x750/2c6005f0edfe2e0b6025767f1183dd1afd1b3235.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 11/1/19\n\n&gt; It was an extremely busy week for economic data with over 40 releases on the calendar. A vast majority came in either inline or worse relative to expectations or the previous period, while only 27% of releases came in stronger than expected or above the prior reading.\n\n&gt; The Chicago Fed\u2019s National Activity Index was the first release of the week, turning back into negative territory in September. The Dallas Fed\u2019s Manufacturing Activity index was also released on Monday and also missed estimates while shifting negative. The Conference Board\u2019s reading on consumer confidence also softened unexpectedly as the spread between present conditions and expectations widened further. Housing data was somewhat mixed as prices slowed slightly, but pending home sales was much better than expected. Wednesday\u2019s GDP release also came in stronger than expected with solid personal consumption. Core PCE and other inflation indicators like the Employment Cost Index were inline with expectations. Finally, Wednesday also saw the FOMC rate decision which resulted in rated cut another 25 bps, as expected. ADP\u2019s stronger than expected employment data, preceded a solid NFP Report on Friday. Nonfarm Payrolls were expected to show 85K added jobs in the month of October which would have been a substantially weaker number than the 136K increase the prior month. Instead, actual results showed 128K added jobs, which was better than all but the highest of estimates (140K). Another focus on Friday was the Markit and ISM readings on manufacturing. Both were expected to improve from the prior month which they in fact did but by less than estimates were calling for. Markit's preliminary PMI was originally showing a stronger reading of 51.5. Instead, the final reading came in at 51.3 which was still the highest reading since April so the report wasn't entirely bad. Meanwhile, the ISM index ticked up off of last month's reading of 47.8, its lowest levels since June of 2009. This was in part thanks to the readings on new orders and employment improving. Aside from these improvements, ISM's indices\u2014unlike Markit\u2014are still showing contraction in the manufacturing space.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The economic calendar slows down next week with around half as many releases as this week. Final durable and capital goods data and factory orders will take up the entirety of Monday\u2019s reports. Durable goods orders are not expected to show any change from the preliminary readings, but factory orders are expected to show moderation in September. On Tuesday, we will get the services counterparts to today\u2019s ISM and Markit manufacturing gauges. While both manufacturing readings missed, ISM\u2019s Non-Manufacturing index is anticipated to rise to 53.5. Quarterly mortgage delinquencies and foreclose data will also be out on Tuesday. Wednesday will see more quarterly data with the Q3 preliminary releases of Nonfarm Productivity and Unit Labor costs. Following this week\u2019s weaker Confidence report from the Conference Board, next Friday we will get further clarification on sentiment with the University of Michigan\u2019s preliminary November data.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Price-to-Earnings Around the Globe\n\n&gt; Every Wednesday, we release our Global Macro Dashboard, which tracks major data economic and market data points from 23 of the largest global economies. One stat we include is each country's P/E ratio for their respective equity markets. India continues to have the highest valuation with a P/E of 26.9. That compares to the US which is now valued at 20.1x earnings and the fifth-highest of the countries tracked. This is also higher than the average P/E for all of these countries which is 17.02. Other countries with notably high valuations include Norway, Germany, and Switzerland. Russia, on the other hand, has by far the lowest valuation of just 6.41, the only country with a P/E in the single digits.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE1.png))**\n\n&gt; Compared to where things stood six months and one year ago, valuations around the globe have collectively risen. The world average now stands at 17.0 versus 16.4 at the end of April and 15.1 last October. While the average multiple has increased, only 60% of the countries tracked have seen valuations increase over the last 6 months while 74% have risen over the past year. Germany's P/E has actually risen the most of these having jumped to the third-highest P/E of all countries (22.6). Six months and one year ago, Germany (EWG) actually had a below-average P/E. Multiple expansion can come in the form of higher prices and/or lower earnings, and in the case of Germany, the culprit has been weaker earnings.\n\n&gt; Even though it currently continues to hold the number one spot on the list, multiples in India (INDA) have actually fallen over the past six months from 30.4 down to the current level of 26.9. Given INDA has fallen over 2.5%, this lower valuation makes better sense than the jump in Germany. Similarly, in regards to the US, the ratio rising to over 20 from 19.28 comes is a result of the S&amp;P 500's 3% gain as earnings have been pretty flat.\n\n&gt; Compared to one year ago, it is a similar story. As is the case now, Russia and Hong Kong have had the lowest valuations over the past six months and one year, although they have risen in that time. The valuation for most countries have risen over the past year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE-6m.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE-Y.png))**\n\n&gt; Summarizing in the table below, there is a bit of a mixed picture in regards to how P/E ratios have changed with performance over the past half-year and year. One would expect the ratio to increase as equities rise, but that has not necessarily been the universal case. For countries like Norway (ENOR) and Germany (EWG), valuations have risen the most in spite of equity markets that have experienced declines over the past six months (Norway's declines being the fourth-worst of the 23 countries) and only modest gains in the past year. On the other hand, Russia (RSX) has the lowest valuation of all countries despite having outperformed dramatically over the last six to twelve months. RSX has also not seen any major surge in valuation in that time as earnings have kept up with prices. Meanwhile, other countries like India (INDA), Switzerland (EWL), Taiwan (EWT) and the US (SPY) have seen this dynamic react more in line with what could be expected.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE-table2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Guidance Trends Lower\n\n&gt; Our good friend (and a former boss) Laszlo Birinyi used to hammer home that \"it's all about the guidance!\" when it comes to earnings reports for specific companies. That is indeed very true as investors discount stocks based on forward projections more than what they've done in the past. On the subject of guidance, this season we've been seeing a lot more companies lower guidance than raise guidance, which has resulted in a pretty big tick lower in our guidance spread reading on our Earnings Explorer page (available to Bespoke Institutional members).\n\n&gt; Our guidance spread reading shows the difference between the percentage of companies that have raised guidance and lowered guidance over the last three months on a rolling basis. A positive reading means more companies have raised guidance than lowered guidance over the last three months and vice versa for a negative reading. As you can see, the reading is currently at -6.48 percentage points, which is well below the historical average of -2.97. (It's notable that historically the average guidance spread has been negative, which tells us that in general companies like to under-promise and over-deliver.) The guidance spread completely tanked in the first quarter of 2019 before stabilizing and rallying back during the summer. While it hasn't been in positive territory all year, the spread did briefly get above its historical average during the Q2 reporting period in July.\n\n&gt; A negative guidance reading means companies are less optimistic about the future than they could be, but it's not necessarily a bearish sign for the stock market. If anything, it gives companies an easier chance at beating estimates going forward as long as the economy doesn't completely fall off a cliff. As you can see in the second chart below that extends our guidance spread reading all the way back to 2003, the current reading is hardly a negative outlier to be concerned about. The only time the spread really collapsed was in mid to late 2008 in the midst of the Financial Crisis.

Still, GDP increased 2% year over year last quarter, slightly below 2.1% year-over-year average growth since the cycle started in July 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/solid-consumer-spending_1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The composition of growth last quarter showed U.S. consumers pulled the economy along once again. Consumer spending contributed 1.9 percentage points to the GDP increase during the quarter, while government spending added 0.4 percentage points. Housing contributed 0.2 percentage points, a nice surprise after residential investment dragged on growth for six straight quarters.\n\n&gt; Business spending reduced overall GDP growth by 0.4 percentage points, its biggest drag on growth since the fourth quarter of 2015. Growth in capital expenditures (capex) has stalled as U.S. companies have shelved expansion plans amid a surge in global uncertainty.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe economy continues to muddle through at an average pace of growth,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhile we\u2019re not surprised to see another dull quarter for capex, we\u2019d like to see business spending eventually pick up this late in the cycle. Higher business spending could provide a boost to productivity, and higher productivity could jumpstart GDP growth.\u201d\n\n&gt; Unfortunately, we don\u2019t expect to see a material increase in capex growth until the United States and China make more significant progress on the trade front. The U.S.-China limited trade deal could provide some lift as tensions thaw, but we think companies may need to see more evidence of a larger compromise before feeling confident enough to spend.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 1st, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9rfOCG3orw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.3.19**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

Then they were beaten down by fears President Donald Trump is starting a new front in the trade wars with China that is unlikely to end any time soon.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe real issue as to why there\u2019s going to be a correction in our view is there\u2019s a massive, massive vacuum here,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivative strategy at BTIG. \u201cIn essence, it\u2019s a month and a half of a vacuum, if you think about the direction of the rhetoric. ... The issues are China, the issues are the Fed and the issues are Brexit. In the first tow, you\u2019re almost not going to hear anything.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Trump, in threatening new tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods on Thursday, said the tariffs would go into effect on Sept. 1 unless China acts, but no new talks are expected before September. Economists said if the tariffs are put in place, the risks of a U.S. recession rise, particularly if businesses step back from investment, and possibly even hiring. But that could also prompt the Fed to cut interest rates to rescue the economy when it meets in September.\n*****\n&gt; After a deluge of corporate headlines in the past several weeks, the earnings season is also winding down with just about 60 major companies reporting in the week ahead, and there are no really significant economic reports until the middle of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the S&amp;P 500 could see a decline to about 2,789, though he still expects to see 3,000 at the end of the year. Stocks started the past week near all-time highs, and the S&amp;P 500 was was down more than 3% in the past week, but still up about 17% for the year-to-date. Odds are high that stocks pull back in August, since for the past eight years, the S&amp;P 500 was negative during August in six of them.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said if stocks decline too much or too long, he expects to see some action from the White House that will halt the selling.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf you\u2019re the president, there\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to allow an economic slowdown in an election year,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n&gt; Barry Knapp, managing partner at Ironsides Macroeconomics, said Friday the escalation of the trade wars has made him more risk adverse, and he would lighten up holdings in the sectors he had favored\u2014industrials, technology and transportation stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe could have a correction ... then we\u2019ll have to see how the policy makers respond to it,\u2032 Knapp said. \u201cThe risks are significant. I think we\u2019ll get a correction. ... We could trade back to the May lows, somewhere around 2,750. then we\u2019ll see how the administration responds. This was a seasonally vulnerable period.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Fed cut its target fed funds rate range Wednesday for the first time in a decade, but it does not have another meeting until Sept. 17, though Fed official hold their annual symposium in Jackson Hole at the end of August.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell disappointed markets when he said the Fed was in a \u201cmidcycle adjustment,\u201d not a longer term rate cutting cycle but by Friday, futures markets were indicating a nearly 100% chance the Fed will cut interest rates in September.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cClearly from the Fed, you\u2019re going to get silence, until the end of the month in Jackson Hole where you may hear something but nothing of materiality,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cAll the Chinese leadership is by the seaside for the next couple of weeks...what you\u2019re going to get for the next two weeks is next to total silence.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said Brexit is also a risk for markets, as the U.K. gets closer to the Oct. 31 deadline to leave the European Union. \u201cIn all likelihood, if you hear something between now and then, it\u2019s basically going to increase the perception that brinkmanship toward the Oct. 31 deadline becomes more a reality every day, and this is reflected in the fact the British sterling is collapsing,\u201d he said. The market has been speculating that the odds of a hard Brexit are increasing, meaning Britain leaves the EU with no plan.\n*****\n&gt; Interest rates and currency wars\n&gt; Currency markets were volatile in the past week, but the dollar index was basically flat by Friday afternoon. Traders were monitoring both the moves in the foreign exchange market and fixed income markets.\n*****\n&gt; As for the bond market, the declines in yields in the past week were dramatic, with about a 30 basis point move in the 10-year yield in just two days. Treasury yields were bouncing along 2016 levels. The 10-year moved from about 2.07% ahead of the Fed news to less than 1.85% It was at 1.87% Friday afternoon.\n*****\n&gt; Yields, which move opposite price, also had moved lower on the Trump trade threats.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNow everybody is waiting for the next tweet. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no economics calendar for when those come out,\u2032 said Jon Hill, rate strategist at BMO.\n*****\n&gt; Hill said traders will be watching the three auctions, $38 billion in 3-year notes Tuesday; a record $27 billion 10-years Wednesday and the record $19 billion 30-year long bond auction, on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Hill said the market will be watching ISM nonmanufacturing data Tuesday to see if the services side of the economy is still holding up. \u201cIt\u2019s been a point of continued strength,\u201d he said, noting at the same time manufacturing has been in decline.\n*****\n&gt; Knapp said he is also worried that the dollar could strengthen on the trade war, and hurt emerging market currencies and U.S. profits. He noted that the Chinese currency weakened against the dollar overnight.\n*****\n&gt; He said he is concerned currency volatility could \u201cjust start to have this big disruption that could be another factor that would just bleed into risk markets like the equity market.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Xqsa1UN.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HTwdHbG.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/YP6RdHX.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/fR24Obo.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KXMGsbm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GRfXD2l.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NYIlTmQ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ySij4wN.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5yXbngJ.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pRIfLVl.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/xCFqEHF.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/zMJO47q.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/kNTJTsB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/pL04DIZ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 8/2/19\n\n&gt; Economic data may have taken a bit of a backseat amidst the FOMC meeting Wednesday and tariff headlines at the tail end of the week, but the US still had a heavy slate with 38 total releases.\n\n&gt; Data was broadly weaker with almost twice as many releases coming in weaker (20) than stronger (11) relative to forecasts (or the prior release when there was no consensus forecast). The Dallas Fed kicked off the week with a weaker than expected reading on manufacturing activity, but it was an improvement from June\u2019s level of negative 12.1. In other manufacturing data, on Thursday we got Markit and ISM PMIs which were mixed. While Markit was stronger, the headline reading of ISM was weaker; new orders did improve, however. Headline factory orders were also weaker, but excluding transportation they were unchanged. As forecasted, personal income and spending weakened while inflation came in at a slower than expected pace on Tuesday. The Conference Board\u2019s Consumer Confidence indices were the main bright spot of the week with stronger readings across the board. Claims data continued to show a slower pace of improvement on Thursday as both initial and continuing claims came in above expectations. Meanwhile, Friday\u2019s Nonfarm Payrolls report was the most inline with expectations since October 2012, coming in only 1K below forecasts of 165K.\n\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-EcoT2.png))**\n\n&gt; Economic data is much lighter next week. The non-manufacturing portions of ISM and Markit PMIs are due on Monday. JOLTS and consumer credit are out on Wednesday. Producer inflation gauges are set to be released Friday.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-EcoN.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Fakeouts\n\n&gt; Throughout the course of the entire year, large caps have been leading the market higher, and they are the only market cap range of the equity market to actually make new highs in the most recent leg higher for equities. After this week's pullback, though, the S&amp;P 500 is coming perilously close to breaking through support at the prior highs from April and last fall. A close below those levels today would not be a great mood-setter for the bulls heading into the weekend.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-SPX.png))**\n\n&gt; For Mid and Small Caps, the picture is even less optimistic. The S&amp;P 400 Mid Cap index never came close to a new high in the most recent rally, but it did appear to break its downtrend from the highs late last year. But that breakout quickly turned to a fakeout this week as the S&amp;P 400 broke back down below its prior downtrend line and is breaking below the 50-DMA today.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-MID.png))**\n\n&gt; For the small-cap Russell 2000, it's an identical picture. In this case, the break above the downtrend line was even more short-lived, and like the S&amp;P 400, the Russell 2000 is not only back below its 50-DMA, but it also isn't that far from breaking below its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-SML.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Earnings Season D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\n\n&gt; Is it happening again? After what has to this point been a perfectly good earnings season for the US stock market sending the S&amp;P 500 to new all-time highs in the process, the President spoiled the party yesterday when he tweeted that a new round of tariffs would be instituted on Chinese Imports. Stocks had erased all of their declines from Powell's Wednesday press conference by mid-day Thursday, but then the President\u2019s tweet sent equity markets reeling with the Dow falling more than 1%, while the yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell back below 2%.\n\n&gt; If this whole scenario sounds familiar to you, that\u2019s because we saw the same thing last quarter. Remember back in April when the S&amp;P 500 rallied to new highs in the early weeks of earnings season? There was a feeling then that the market was finally breaking out of its rut and on the path to a sustained breakout. But then over the first weekend of May, on a Sunday afternoon no less, the President sent out a series of tweets outlining his plan for increased tariffs on Chinese imports. The following Monday, the market opened lower and kept falling throughout the month. By the end of May, the S&amp;P 500 was down 6.6% for the month, making it the worst May for the S&amp;P 500 since 2010. August has historically been an iffy month for the stock market as many on Wall Street take vacations and try to relax, but if the market follows the earnings season script from last quarter, this will be an August of little rest.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-Earnings-Season.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# President Takes Matters into His Own Hands\n\n&gt; The President has been frustrated with the Federal Reserve\u2019s prior rate hikes and now the lack of a more substantial cut in rates. Just the other day, Trump was quoted as saying, \u201cObama had zero interest rates, we have \u2018normalized\u2019 rates. While the Fed hasn\u2019t helped the President\u2019s cause, he has seemingly taken matters into his own hands with his policy towards China. Each time he ratchets up the rhetoric against China, it tends to put additional downward pressure on interest rates, and following Thursday\u2019s tweets, the yield on the 10-year plummetted below 1.9%.\n\n&gt; Ironically enough, the last time the 10-year yield was this low was on Election Day 2016. While short-term borrowing costs are up as the FOMC has hiked rates during Trump's time in office, the yield on the 10-year isn\u2019t much different. Under the eight years of President Obama, the yield on the 10-year averaged 2.47%, while under Trump the average yield has been 2.57%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-10-Year-Yield.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows a shorter-term look at the 10-year yield over the last year and it has practically been in free-fall the entire time. Ever since late 2018, every time the yield has attempted to make a move above its 50-DMA, it has reversed lower, with the most recent leg lower in May coinciding with another series of tweets concerning tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080119-10YR-Yield.png))**\n\n&gt; While not a lot of stocks have benefitted from the President\u2019s policy tweets on Chinese tariffs, the impact of lower interest rates has been cheered on by the homebuilders as they have practically been a completely inverse image of the move in rates. Just yesterday, the group hit a new high before pulling back a bit, but lower long-term interest rates mean lower mortgage payments, and that helps to make housing more affordable for millions of millennials looking for a place of their own.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080119-1-Homebuilders.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Outside Day for Gold (GLD)\n\n&gt; Even though assets have been selling off across the board in response to Wednesday's Fed decision and the President's announcement of increased tariffs yesterday, there is one bullish point to be found. Yesterday, gold (GLD) had initially moved slightly lower around the open but then surged into the close, finishing the day only a couple of cents off of the intraday high. Not only did GLD fully recoup the morning's losses, but it also gained back the previous day's losses and then some. This outside day/bullish engulfing pattern is typically seen as a bullish technical signal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; This pattern has occurred a total of 35 times in the history of the Gold ETF (GLD). Below we show the 10 previous times that this pattern was observed after not having occurred in the previous six months. Despite being a bullish setup, performance in the next week has actually had a negative bias with an average return of -0.57%. The past five times have seen a loss in the following week. Likewise, three months out sees better than average returns but the probability of GLD trading higher is the just the same as a coinflip. But, generally, in the months and year after, GLD continues to trend higher on average with more consistent gains in the next month, 6 months, and year periods. Returns are also better than normal across these time frames.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-GLD-Table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Solid Jobs Growth in July\n\n&gt; The job market continues to be a pillar of strength for the U.S. economy.\n\n&gt; Nonfarm payrolls rose 164,000 in July, in line with consensus estimates for a 165,000 gain, according to the jobs report released August 2. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Solid Jobs Growth in July, job creation has slowed slightly this year amid the aging economic expansion, but not to levels that concern us. The 12-month average payrolls gain through July was 187,000, still an above-average pace for the expansion.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NSNykYz.png))**\n\n&gt; Strength in the job market is especially important these days as U.S. consumers increasingly bear the weight of economic growth. Consumer activity added 2.9 percentage points to second quarter gross domestic product (GDP), carrying GDP growth to 2.1%.\n\n&gt; Initial jobless claims, a leading economic indicator, have also pointed to firm labor-market conditions. The four-week average for unemployment claims fell to the fifth-lowest level of the expansion through July 26.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve been encouraged by the labor market\u2019s resiliency amid recent global uncertainty,\u201d said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cA solid labor market should continue to bolster consumer confidence and buoy economic activity.\u201d\n\n&gt; Average hourly earnings grew 3.2% year over year in July, a faster pace than June\u2019s growth and at a healthy clip for the U.S. consumer. Wages constitute about 70% of business costs, so we\u2019re hoping meaningful pay increases will eventually help lift consumer inflation, countering weakness in global demand. The unemployment rate climbed to 3.7%, still near a cycle low.\n\n# August: Better in Pre-Election Years, But Still Not Great\n\n&gt; Money flows from harvesting made August a great stock market month in the first half of the Twentieth Century. It was the best month from 1901 to 1951. In 1900, 37.5% of the population was farming. Now that less than 2% farm, August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 31 years, 1988-2018 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.\n\n&gt; In pre-election years since 1950, Augusts\u2019 rankings improve modestly: #7 DJIA, #8 S&amp;P 500, #10 NASDAQ (since 1971), #9 Russell 1000 and #10 Russell 2000 (since 1979).

DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%\u2014which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011 and 2013 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts\u2019 average decline. A strong August in 2014 of S&amp;P 3.8% and NASDAQ 4.8% preceded corrections of 7.4% and 8.4% respectively from mid-September to mid-October.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 2nd, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 08.04.19**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXABeeJyjmk))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/5yXbngJ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/sbVMJJt.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN ON MONDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/FbGY4C3.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/9xQ33Wb.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.5.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QkNOaou.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.5.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Qr69U5R.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/8G63Id7.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.6.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9vteWuZ.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Tw9YZSa.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.6.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/PqGmI08.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/5s4M7AI.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/jbWWNAf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.7.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/fstefBV.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/C5P3ol3.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.7.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/gkInKrR.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/YMyK01L.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/p427veL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.8.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Uv1oGk4.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/dMFBkoU.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.8.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/idcjqo2.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/aqe4wEN.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.9.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/buB0ahS.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.9.19 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q6xhOFT.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. $34.02 \n&gt; **Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
